Dowry Prohibition Act is confirmed including the sentence.
The appeal is allowed with regard to the appellants 3 to 5
and sentence imposed on them is set aside. The fine
amount paid by them shall be refunded after appeal time.
The fine amount paid by 1st Appellant for the offence U/
s.498-A IPC shall be refunded to him after appeal time.ﬂ
4. Thus, conviction and sentence of Respondent Nos.1 and
2 under Section 3 of the Act 1961 was maintained, however,
they were acquitted for the offence under Section 498A of the
IPC and Section 4 of the Act 1961.
5. In the Revision, the High Court has dealt with the case
in a very cryptic manner as the learned counsel appearing for
the respondents did not argue the case on merit rather pleaded
for mercy and requested to reduce the sentence taking a lenient
view. The High Court reduced the sentence to 4 days, as the
said sentence had already been served/undergone by them.
6. Hence this appeal by the complainant-appellant
Sarvarala Sai Sree.
7. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and
perused the record. So far as the conviction of the respondent
under Section 3 of the Act, 1961 is concerned, there is no
reason for us to interfere with the same. Thus, the question
remains restricted only to the quantum of punishment. Section
3 of the Act, 1961 reads as under:
ﬁ3. Penalty for giving or taking dowry Œ (1) 
If any
person, after the commencement of this Act, gives or takes
or abets the giving or taking of dowry, he shall be
punishable with imprisonment for a term which 
shall not
be less than five years and with the fine
 which 
shall
not be less than fifteen thousand rupees
 or the amount
of the value of such dowry, whichever is more.

2. The facts and the circumstances involved in the case
has shocked the conscience of the Court and we take a serious
note that neither the trial court nor the High Court proceeded in
accordance with law rather acted on their own whims and
fancies as if the courts are not bound to follow the law made
by the competent legislature.
The trial Court convicted the respondents under Section
498-A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short ﬁIPC) and
awarded the sentence of three (3) years and imposed a fine
of Rs.2000/- (Rupees two thousand only) and in case of non
payment of fine, a further sentence to undergo simple
imprisonment for a period of three (3) months. They were also
convicted under Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,
1961 (for short ‚Act, 1961™) and imposed a sentence for a
period of 3 months each and to pay a fine of Rs.3000/-(Rupees
three thousand only) each and in default of payment, they were
sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one
month of each of the offence.
3. Aggrieved, the respondents filed appeal before the
Sessions Court. The first appellate court dealt with the case.
Relevant part of the order runs as under:
ﬁ20. On recording findings in the aforesaid points this court
finds there was no legally acceptable evidence for
convicting A1 for the offence U/s 498-A IPC and A3 to A5
for the offence U/s. 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. So,
appellants 3 to 5 are entitled for acquittal. Appellants 1 and
2 are liable for punishment only U/s.3 of Dowry Prohibition
Act for having accepted three Demand Drafts and not
explaining the same though burden is on them as per
Sec.8-A.
21. In the result, the appeal is partly allowed. 1st Appellant
is acquitted of the charge U/s.498-A IPC, but his conviction
for the U/s.3 of Dowry Prohibition Act is confirmed including
the sentence. The conviction of 2nd appellant U/s.3 of

sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than five years.ﬂ
(Emphasis added)
8. In the instant case, the minimum sentence fixed by the
legislature is five years, however, the court in an appropriate
case after recording the reason may award the sentence lesser
than five years, but the fine shall not be less than Rs.15,000/-
or the amount of the value of such dowry, whichever is more.
9. In view of the above, we are not able to understand as
under what circumstances without recording any reason
whatsoever it was permissible for the trial Court to award the
sentence less than five (5) years. Awarding of punishment of 3
months by the trial Court was hopelessly disproportionate
particularly in view of the fact that no mitigating circumstance
has been pointed out by the trial court. The High Court failed in
its duty to take up the matter in its revisional power under
Section 401 r/w Section 386(e) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 and enhance the punishment commensurate
to the offence committed by them. We are appalled that the High
Court reduced the sentence to four days.
10. In 
State of U.P. v. Shri Kishan, 
AIR 2005 SC 1250,
this Court has emphasised that just and proper sentence should
be imposed. The Court held:
 ﬁ–– Any liberal attitude by imposing meager sentences
or 
taking too sympathetic view merely on account of
lapse of time in respect of such offences will be result-
wise counter productive
 in the long run and against
societal interest which needs to be cared for and
strengthened by string of deterrence inbuilt in the
sentencing system.
The Court will be failing in its duty if appropriate
punishment is not awarded for a crime which has been
committed not only against the individual victim but also
against the society to which the criminal and victim
belong. The punishment to be awarded for a crime must
not be irrelevant but it should conform to and be
consistent with the atrocity and brutality with which the
crime has been perpetrated, the enormity of the crime
warranting public abhorrence and it should ‚respond to
the society™s cry for justice against the criminal™.ﬂ

Bengal,

11. In 
State of Rajasthan v. Vinod Kumar,
 AIR 2012 SC
2301, this Court while dealing with the issue of minimum
sentence provided under the statute held:
ﬁ19. Awarding punishment lesser than the minimum
prescribed under Section 376, IPC, is an exception to
the general rule. Exception clause is to be invoked only
in exceptional circumstances where the conditions
incorporated in the exception clause itself exist. It is a
settled legal proposition that exception clause is always
required to be strictly interpreted even if there is a
hardship to any individual. Exception is provided with the
object of taking it out of the scope of the basic law and
what is included in it and what legislature desired to be
excluded. The natural presumption in law is that but for
the proviso, the enacting part of the Section would have
included the subject-matter of the proviso, the enacting
part should be generally given such a construction which
would make the exceptions carved out by the proviso
necessary and a construction which would make the
exceptions unnecessary and redundant should be
avoided. Proviso is used to remove special cases from
the general enactment and provide for them separately.

Proviso may change the very concept of the intendment
of the enactment by insisting on certain mandatory
conditions to be fulfilled in order to make the enactment
workable.(Vide: S. Sundaram Pillai, etc. v. V.R.
Pattabiraman, AIR 1985 SC 582; Union of India and Ors.
v. M/s. Wood Papers Ltd. and Anr., AIR 1991 SC 2049;
Grasim Industries Ltd. and Anr. v. State of Madhya
Pradesh and Anr., AIR 2000 SC 66; Laxminarayan R.

Chacko, AIR 2010 SC 2626; and Commissioner of
Central Excise, New Delhi v. Hari Chand Shri Gopal and
Ors., (2011) 1 SCC 236).
20. Thus, the law on the issue can be summarised to the
effect that punishment should always be proportionate/
commensurate to the gravity of offence–. The court has
to decide the punishment after considering all
aggravating and mitigating factors and the circumstances
in which the crime has been committed. Conduct and
state of mind of the accused ––and the gravity of the
criminal act are the factors of paramount importance. The
court must exercise its discretion in imposing the
punishment objectively considering the facts and
circumstances of the case. The power under the proviso
is not to be used indiscriminately in a routine, casual and
cavalier manner for the reason that an exception clause
requires strict interpretation–
The court while exercising the discretion in the
exception clause has to record ﬁexceptional reasonsﬂ for
resorting to the proviso. Recording of such reasons is
sine qua non for granting the extraordinary relief. What
is adequate and special would depend upon several
factors and no straight jacket formula can be laid down.ﬂ
12. Undoubtedly, imposition of sentence is in the realm of
discretion of the court and unless the sentence is found to be
grossly inadequate, the appellate court would not be justified
in interfering with the discretionary order of sentence. This view
stands fortified by the judgment of this Court in 
Ram Sanjiwan
Singh & Ors. v. State of Bihar, 
AIR 1996 SC 3265.
13. In view of the above, the orders impugned are not
sustainable in the eyes of law. Thus, we allow the appeal, set
aside the sentence and remand the matter back to the High
Court to determine the quantum of punishment. However, to cut
short, we issue notice to the respondents for enhancement of
punishment to which they can file the reply within a period of 8
weeks from today before the High Court and the High Court is
requested to pass an appropriate order of punishment
considering the law referred to hereinabove. As the matter is
old, we request the High Court to decide the case in regard to
quantum of punishment within a period of 3 months after the
reply is filed by the respondents.
With these observations, the appeal stands disposed of.

Explained.
The appellant was prosecuted on the allegation that
in night of occurrence at 12.30 A.M., he jumped into the
courtyard of the prosecutrix, a 19 year old girl, and raped
her. The trial court convicted him u/ss 376 and 450, IPC
and sentenced him to 7 years RI and 2 years RI,
respectively, under the two courts. The High Court
dismissed the appeal.
Allowing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 
1.1. In a case involving charge of rape, the
evidence of the prosecutrix is most vital. If it is found
credible and inspires total confidence, it can be relied
upon even sans corroboration. The court may, however,
if it is hesitant to place implicit reliance on it, look into
other evidence to lend assurance to it short of
corroboration required in the case of an accomplice.
Such weight is given to the prosecutrix™s evidence
because her evidence is on par with the evidence of an
injured witness, and, therefore, it is the duty of the court
to scrutinize it carefully. The court must, therefore, with
its rich experience evaluate such evidence with care and
circumspection and only after its conscience is satisfied
about its creditworthiness, rely upon it. [para 6] [14-D-F]

It is difficult to infer that the prosecutrix was raped by the

2. The appellant was tried by the Additional Sessions
Judge, Faridabad in Sessions Case No.RBT-8 of 1999 for
offences punishable under Sections 376 and 450 of the IPC.
1.2. In the instant case, it would be extremely
dangerous to rely on evidence of the prosecutrix. She
knew the appellant being her neighbour. It is her case that
she used to write letters to him. In the examination-in-chief
she stated at one stage that the appellant raped her and
immediately thereafter retracted the statement and stated
that he did not rape her but attempted to rape her. She
refused to acknowledge that the statement which was
read over to her was made by her to the police. She
expressed surprise as to how her signatures appeared
on the said statement. The Public Prosecutor had to,
therefore, declare her hostile. The conscience of the
Court would not permit it to rely on such evidence. It
would be hazardous to confirm the conviction on the
prosecutrix™s sole testimony. [para 8] [15-H; 16-A-C]
 1.3.
The evidence of PW-1, the brother of the
prosecutrix, is far from satisfactory and is incapable of
offering any corroboration to the prosecutrix™s evidence,
assuming her evidence does spell out the case of rape.
He stated that the appellant had closed the prosecutrix™s
mouth and was trying to rape her. He stated that he
apprehended the appellant and woke up his father. He
further stated that he told the police that the appellant
had attempted to rape the prosecutrix. He was confronted
with his police statement where he had stated that the
appellant had raped the prosecutrix. He went to the extent
of saying that he did not make any statement to the
police. No reliance can be placed on such evidence. [para
9] [16-D, E-H]
1.4. The prosecution has failed to examine the doctor
who had examined the prosecutrix. This is a serious lapse
on the part of the prosecution. The MLR was produced in
the court by PW-6, the Medical Record Technician. It is
true that lapses on the part of the prosecution should not
lead to unmerited acquittals. This is, however, subject to
the rider that in such a situation the evidence on record

[RANJANA PRAKASH DESAI, J.]
By judgment and order dated 3/8/2001, learned Additional
Sessions Judge convicted the appellant for the offence
punishable under Section 376 of the IPC and sentenced him
to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years and to pay
a fine of Rs.5,000/-. In default of payment of fine, he was
directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one
year. The appellant was also convicted for offence punishable
under Section 450 of the IPC and sentenced to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of
Rs.1,000/-. In default of payment of fine, he was directed to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two months. The
substantive sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Being
aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant
filed criminal appeal in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. By
the impugned judgment, the High Court dismissed the said
appeal. Hence, this appeal, by special leave.
3. According to the prosecution on 12/3/1999, the
prosecutrix who was examined as PW-5 was watching a film
on television along with her younger brothers till 12.30 in the
night. Both her brothers went to sleep. She went outside the
veranda to relieve herself. The appellant, who is her neighbour,
was standing on the wall of his house. He jumped from the wall,
came to her house and raped her. When the prosecutrix raised
alarm, her elder brother PW-1 Fateh Ram came there
whereupon the appellant ran away. The prosecutrix lodged her
complaint on 14/3/1999 on the basis of which investigation was
set into motion. After completion of investigation, the appellant
came to be charged as aforesaid.
4. The prosecution case is sought to be established
through the evidence of the prosecutrix and her brother PW-1
Fateh Ram. The appellant denied the prosecution case and
pleaded innocence. Having gone through the evidence
adduced by the prosecution, the trial court convicted the
appellant and sentenced him as aforesaid. The High Court
confirmed the conviction and sentence of the appellant.
5. Mr. D.P. Singh, learned counsel for the appellant,
strenuously urged that the evidence of the prsoecutrix is totally
unreliable and deserves to be discarded. She has not
supported the prosecution. Evidence of her brother also does
not substantiate the prosecution case. The doctor who
examined the prosecutrix has not been examined by the
prosecution. Counsel submitted that conviction of the appellant
must, therefore, be set side. Mr. Deepkaran Dalal, learned AAG
for the State, however, submitted that the prosecution case can
be sustained on the basis of the evidence of the prosecutrix.
The Medico Legal Report (MLR) establishes the case of rape.
The appeal, therefore, deserves to be dismissed.
6. In a case involving charge of rape the evidence of the
prosecutrix is most vital. If it is found credible; if it inspires total
confidence, it can be relied upon even sans corroboration. The
court may, however, if it is hesitant to place implicit reliance on
it, look into other evidence to lend assurance to it short of
corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. [See:
State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain
1
].
Such weight is given to the prosecutrix™s evidence because her
evidence is on par with the evidence of an injured witness which
seldom fails to inspire confidence. Having placed the
prosecutrix™s evidence on such a high pedestal, it is the duty
of the court to scrutinize it carefully, because in a given case
on that lone evidence a man can be sentenced to life
imprisonment. The court must, therefore, with its rich experience
evaluate such evidence with care and circumspection and only
after its conscience is satisfied about its creditworthiness rely
upon it.
7. We shall now read the prosecutrix™s evidence keeping
the above caution in mind. There is no dispute about the fact
that when the incident-in-question took-place the prosecutrix
was 19 years old. In her evidence she stated that on 12/03/
1991 she was watching a movie on the television along with

her brothers. The movie got over at about 12.30 a.m.
Thereafter, her brothers went to sleep. After that she went to
the compound to ease herself. The appellant, who is her
neighbour, was standing on the wall. He jumped over the wall,
came to her house and raped her. She immediately retracted
her statement and stated that the appellant did not rape her but
undressed her and attempted to rape her. Thereafter, she
raised a cry. Her brother PW-1 Fateh Ram came there. The
appellant ran away. The prosecutrix further went on to say that
because the appellant tried to rape her she was depressed
and hence she consumed celphos tablets. She, then,
categorically stated that she did not make any statement to the
police. She admitted that statement Ex-P1 contained her
signatures, but, she denied that the said statement, which was
read over to her was made by her to the police. She further
stated that she did not know how her signatures appeared on
the said statement. The prosecutrix having completely given a
go-by to the prosecution case learned Public Prosecutor
declared her hostile. He cross-examined her. Surprisingly, in
the cross-examination the prosecutrix changed her version and
stated that the appellant had raped her and her earlier
statement that the appellant had not raped her is not correct.
In her cross-examination conducted by the defence counsel, the
prosecutrix stated that she did not raise any alarm when she
saw the appellant standing on the wall of his house. She stated
that the appellant removed her salwar, removed all her clothes
and raped her for about five minutes. Though, she stated that
the accused had closed her mouth and did not allow her to
struggle, it does not stand to reason that till the appellant untied
the string of her salwar and removed all her clothes she could
not raise a cry. Her cries would have brought her brother
immediately to the room. Pertinently, the prosecutrix stated that
the appellant used to visit her house. She admitted that prior
to the occurrence she used to write letters to him.
8. It would be extremely dangerous to rely on such
evidence. The prosecutrix obviously knew the appellant being
her neighbour. It is her case that she used to write letters to
him. In the examination-in-chief she stated at one stage that the
appellant raped her and immediately thereafter retracted the
statement and stated that he did not rape her but he attempted
to rape her. She refused to acknowledge that the statement
which was read over to her was made by her to the police. She
expressed surprise as to how her signatures appeared on the
said statement. The Public Prosecutor had to, therefore,
declare her hostile. Our conscience would not permit us to rely
on such evidence. It would be hazardous to confirm the
conviction on the prosecutrix™s sole testimony. Let us, therefore,
see whether there is any other evidence on record which bears
out the prosecution case.
9. PW-1 Fateh Ram brother of the porsecutrix stated in his
evidence that at the relevant time he was sleeping in his house.
The prosecutrix and his two brothers were witnessing film on
the television. The film ended at about 12.30 a.m. in the night.
Thereafter the prosecutrix went out to ease herself. He also got
up after some time to ease himself and went out. According to
him, he found the appellant in their house. He stated that the
appellant had closed the prosecutrix™s mouth and was trying to
rape her. He, then, apprehended the appellant and woke up his
father. The appellant was beaten-up. After his brother came he
was allowed to go. He stated that he did not make any statement
to the police. He stated that he did not tell the police that he
went to sleep while the prosecutrix was watching television
along with her brothers. He stated that he had told the police
that the appellant had attempted to rape the prosecutrix. He
was confronted with his police statement where he had stated
that the appellant had raped the prosecutrix. Thus, on a vital
aspect he has contradicted himself. His evidence is, therefore,
far from satisfactory and incapable of offering any corroboration
to the prosecutrix™s evidence, assuming her evidence does
spell out the case of rape. He went to the extent of saying that
he did not make any statement to the police. No reliance can
be placed on such evidence.

10. Faced with such a situation, we were anxious to find
out whether there can be any clinching medical evidence
suggesting rape, but, unfortunately, the prosecution has failed
to examine Dr. Anjali Shah, who had examined the prosecutrix.
The MLR was produced in the court by PW-6 J.B. Bhardwaj,
Medical Record Technician. This is a serious lapse on the part
of the prosecution. We are aware that lapses on the part of the
prosecution should not lead to unmerited acquittals. This is,
however, subject to the rider that in such a situation the evidence
on record must be clinching so that the lapses of the
prosecution could be condoned. Such is not the case here. The
MLR does suggest that the hymen of the prosecutrix was torn.
It is also true that the prosecution has brought on record FSL
Report which shows that human semen was detected on the
salwar of the prosecutrix and on the underwear of the accused.
However, it is difficult to infer from this that the prosecutrix was
raped by the appellant. The prosecutrix herself has vacillated
on this aspect. It was pointed out that no injuries were found
on the prosecutrix. We do not attach much importance to this
aspect because presence of injuries is not a must to prove
commission of rape. But the prosecutrix™s evidence is so infirm
that it deserves to be rejected. Her brother has come out with
a case that the appellant tried to rape the prosecutrix. He did
not say that the appellant raped the prosecutrix. Taking an
overall view of the matter, we find it difficult to sustain the
prosecution case that the prosecutrix was raped by the
appellant. This is a case where the appellant must be given
benefit of doubt
11. In the circumstances, the impugned judgment
convicting the appellant under Sections 376 and 450 of the IPC
and sentencing him for the said offences is quashed and set

he is required in any other case.

Executing court holding the decree as contrary to provisions
of the Act and granting the tenant time to deposit arrears of

Accommodation Control Act, 1961 Œ ss. 12(1) (a) and 13 .
In a suit u/s 12(1)(a) of the Madhya Pradesh
Accommodation Control Act, 1961 for eviction and arrears
of rent, a compromise decree was passed to the effect
that the respondent-tenant would pay the arrears within
6 months failing which the appellant-landlord would be
entitled to possession. In execution proceedings, the
executing court allowed the tenant 15 days time to
deposit the amount and on such deposit dismissed the
execution application. The executing court further held
that in view of s. 13(1)(a) of the Act the compromise
decree insofar as it provided for eviction of the
respondent in the event of his failure to make the deposit
of arrears within the stipulated time was void. The High
Court dismissed the revision petition filed by the landlord-
appellant on three grounds: (i) that the appellant need not
have entered into a compromise which led to the decree;
(ii) When the execution petition was filed by the appellant
and the executing court granted 15 days time to the
respondent to pay the balance of the arrears of rent and
since the appellant did not choose to challenge the said
order, it implied that the appellant acquiesced in the said
order, therefore, the appellant-landlord was not entitled
for the recovery of the possession of his property; and
(iii) in view of the fact that the respondent eventually
deposited the arrears of rent his possession was required
to be protected in view of ss.12(3) and 13(5) of the Act.
Allowing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 
1.1. All the reasons given by the High Court are
unsustainable in law. The High Court did not examine the
correctness of the conclusion of the executing court that
the compromise decree insofar as it pertained to the
eviction of the respondent in the event of his failure to
deposit the arrears of rent within time stipulated in the
compromise decree is inconsistent with the provisions of
the Act and, therefore, void. [para 12 and 14] [27-D; 28-A]
1.2. The reasons which compelled the appellant to
enter the compromise are irrelevant for the issue at hand.
The respondent-judgment debtor cannot flout the
compromise decree with impunity on the ground that his
opponent entered the compromise in view of some
serious dispute about the maintainability of his claim. The
conduct of the appellant in entering the compromise only
debars the appellant to recover possession within the
period of six months from the date of the compromise
decree whether the respondent paid the arrears of rent
or not till the last date. [para 14] [28-B-D]
1.3. Failure of the appellant to challenge the order of
executing court dated 23.11.2005 (by which it granted
time to tenant to deposit the rent) would not debar him
from recovery of possession, for the reasons: (i) The only
source which confers powers on the civil court to
enlarge time is found u/s 148 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908. It is obvious from the language of the
Section, such a power can be exercised only in a case
where a period is fixed or granted by the court for doing
of any act prescribed by the Code. In a compromise
decree such as the one on hand, the stipulation that the

judgment debtor is required to make the payment of the
money within a specified period is a stipulation by
agreement between the parties and it is not a period fixed
by the court. Therefore, s.148 CPC has no application to
such a situation. [para 15] [28-F-G; 29-A-C]

AIR 1968 SC 86 Œ relied on.
(ii) The order dated 23.11.2005 virtually amounts to
the modification of the decree and is without jurisdiction
on the part of the executing court, therefore, a nullity. It
is a settled principle of law that the executing court
cannot go beyond the decree. It has no jurisdiction to
modify a decree. It must execute the decree as it is. It is
well settled that such a void order can create neither legal
rights nor obligations. Therefore, the appellant cannot be
denied his right to recover possession of the property in
dispute on the ground that he did not choose to
challenge such a void order. [para 15-16] [29-C-D, F-G]

Others
  
2008 (17)  SCR 636  = (2009) 2 SCC 294 - relied on.
1.4. Section 12(1)(a) of the Act enables the landlord
to evict the tenant if he could successfully establish that
the tenant did in fact fall in arrears of rent and had neither
tendered nor paid the amount within the period specified
despite a demand. [para 19] [30-D-E]
1.5. Section 13 clearly indicates that the payment or
the deposit of rent into the court by the judgment debtor
(tenant) is contemplated only during the pendency of the
suit for eviction or an appeal (by the tenant) against a
decree or order of eviction. Section 13 has no application
to the execution proceedings of a decree for eviction
when the tenant had already been adjudged to be in
default of payment of the rent to the landlord. Therefore,
the executing court™s interpretation of s. 13(1) is
unsustainable. [para 24-25] [33-B-C, D, E-F]
Smt. Nai Bahu v. Lala Ramnarayan and Others 
1978 (1)

1.6. In the result, neither the judgment under appeal,
nor the executing court™s order dismissing the landlord™s
execution petition can be sustained. The execution
petition filed by the appellant is allowed. The executing
court will take necessary steps for evicting the
respondent from the disputed premises and handing
over the possession of the same to the appellant. [para

suit came to be decreed 
ex parte
. The said decree came to
be set-aside on an application filed by the respondent with a
direction to file the written statement and also deposit the entire
arrears within 30 days in the court.
3. On 25.7.2004 a compromise memo signed by both the
parties came to be filed under which the respondent
acknowledged his liability to pay arrears of rent to the appellant
to the tune of Rs.11710/- and also costs quantified to Rs.4000/
-. The respondent also agreed to pay the amount within a
period of six months. It was also specifically agreed as follows:
ﬁH. If the defendant violates any of the aforesaid conditions,
the plaintiff shall be entitled to get the vacant possession
of suit accommodation from the defendant wherein
defendant shall have no objection.ﬂ
4. In view of the said compromise, the matter was referred
to the lok adalat and the civil suit was decreed in terms of the
compromise.
5. On 21.7.2005 the appellant filed an application for the
execution of the compromise decree alleging that the
respondent failed to fulfil his obligations arising out of the
compromise decree and, therefore, the appellant is entitled to
recover possession of the premises. The events that followed
are narrated by the High Court in the judgment under appeal
as followsŒ
ﬁOn 04/10/2005 after appearance respondent filed
objections wherein it was alleged that signatures were
obtained by the petitioner on the said compromise under
undue influence and no receipt was issued by the petitioner
for a sum of Rs.10,000/-, which was paid by the
respondent. The said application was dismissed by the
learned Executing Court vide order dated 24/10/2005 and
it was directed that since the Executing Court cannot go
behind the decree, therefore, warrant of possession be
issued. Again on 09/11/2005 objections were filed in which
adjustment of Rs.25,000/- was claimed. Vide order dated
22/11/2005 objections filed by the respondent was
dismissed, however 15 days time was granted to deposit
the amount. Since the amount was deposited by the
respondent, therefore, vide order dated 23/12/2005
Executing Court dismissed the execution holding that
since the relief of possession of suit accommodation was
in alternate and the respondent has deposited the amount
though belatedly, therefore, petitioner is not entitled for
alternative relief and the execution petitioner was
dismissed, against which an appeal was filed on 07/01/
2006 and vide order dated 16/03/2006 learned Appellate
Court held that the Executing Court has no jurisdiction to
go behind the decree but no relief was granted to the
petitioner against which Writ Petition was filed by the
petitioner on 05/02/2006, which was numbered as 
WP
No.6163/06
 and 
vide order dated 08.02.2007
 Writ
Petition 
was allowed and the matter was remanded
 to
the Executing Court with direction to decide the points
framed by the Writ Court for determination.ﬂ
(emphasis supplied)
6. The operative part of the order reads as follows:
ﬁ10. It is for this reason, I am constrained to remand the
case to executing court for deciding the issue again
arising out of the execution application filed by the
petitioner. The executing court will decide the application
keeping in view the law laid down in Nai Bahu
1
 case and
any other case which governs the field and will record
categorical finding on following issues:
1. Whether compromise decree dated 25.7.2005 is nullity
in so far as it relates to a relief of eviction of respondent
from the suit house?

2. If not then whether default alleged is made out by the
petitioner so as to entitle him to execute the decree for
eviction?
7. On remand, by the order dated 17.4.2007, the executing
court recorded a finding that the respondent had paid the entire
amount due under the compromise decree in the executing
court although such a payment was made beyond the period
of six months stipulated in the compromise decree. Further, the
executing court examined the submission made by the
respondent that in view of section 13(1)(a) of the Act the
compromise decree insofar as it provided for eviction of the
respondent in the event of his failure to make the deposit of
arrears within the stipulated time is void. The operative portion
of the order of the executing court reads as follows:
ﬁ20. –.  Hence, in respect of issue No.A it is decided that
the compromise decree is void in respect of eviction relief
and no such eviction can be ordered contrary to the
provisions of M.P. Accommodation Control Act for default
in payment of rent. Since executable part of compromise
decree has been held to be void, in such circumstances
the executing court cannot pass an order for eviction for
default in payment of arrears of rent or remaining part of
arrears of rent. Accordingly issue No.B is decided.ﬂ
8. Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant herein again
approached the High Court by way of a Civil Revision Petition
No.173 of 2007. The High Court by its judgment under appeal
dated 28.10.2010 dismissed the revision. Hence this appeal.
9. The reasons recorded by the High Court are as follows-
ﬁ8. Undoubtedly entire rent was deposited by the
respondent. It is also not in dispute that the amount was
not deposited within a period of six months as per terms
and condition of the compromise decree. However, later
on the rent was deposited. Since the ground was available
to the petitioner under Section 12(1)(a) of M.P.
Accommodation Control Act as the respondent did not
tender the rent within a period of two months from the date
of notice and also did not deposit the rent within one month
from the date of receipt of summons under Section 13(1)
of the Act, therefore, there was no reason for the petitioner
to enter into compromise and condone the delay in
depositing the rent and give further time to the respondent
of another six months to deposit the rent. It appears that
since there was serious dispute between the parties
relating to the title of the petitioner, therefore, the
concession was given by the petitioner. Vide order dated
23.11.2005 learned Executing Court has further extended
the time by another 15 days for depositing the arrears of
rent keeping in view the good conduct of the respondent.
9. From perusal of the order dated 23.11.2005 it appears
that the amount of Rs.10,000/- was deposited by the
respondent on that day only. Thus, vide judgment and
decree dated 25.07.2004 respondent was required to
deposit the arrears within six months which expired on
24.01.2005. In execution petition, time was further
extended by 15 days vide order dated 23.11.2005. The
order dated 23.11.2005 was not challenged by the
petitioner, meaning thereby the petitioner agreed with the
order whereby time was further extended.
10. Apart from this if the rent is deposited by the tenant
as per Section 13(1) of the Act, then respondent is entitled
for protection against eviction under Section 12(3) and
13(5) of the Act and in case of default for three consecutive
months another suit for eviction can be filed against
respondent. In the facts and circumstances of the case, this
Court is of the view that no illegality has been committed
by the learned Executing Court in dismissing the execution
petition in full satisfaction. Hence, petition filed by the
petitioner has no merits and the same is dismissed.ﬂ

10. It is 
argued
 by the learned counsel for the appellant
that the 
executing court erred
 in coming to the conclusion that
the compromise decree is inconsistent with the section 13 of
the Act and the 
High Court simply failed
 to record its finding
on the correctness of the order of the executing court but went
astray.
11. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the
respondent submitted that the executing court™s conclusion that
the compromise decree insofar as it provided for the eviction
of the respondent is void and calls for no interference in view
of section 13 of the Act even though the High Court failed to
examine the said question.
12. The High Court did not examine the correctness of the
conclusion of the executing court that the compromise decree
insofar as it pertained to the eviction of the respondent in the
event of his failure to deposit the arrears of rent within time
stipulated in the compromise decree is inconsistent with the
provisions of the Act and therefore void.
13. From the judgment under appeal, the relevant portion
of which is extracted earlier at para 9, it appears that the High
Court dismissed the case of the appellant on three grounds (i)
that the appellant need not have entered into a compromise
which led to the decree. According to the High Court, such a
compromise was entered into by the appellant as in the view
of the High Court - there was a serious dispute about the title
of the appellant (ii) When the execution petition was filed by the
appellant, the executing court by its order dated 23.11.2005
granted 15 days time to the respondent to pay the balance of
the arrears of rent. The appellant did not choose to challenge
the said order. According to the High Court, such failure of the
appellant implies that the appellant acquiesced in the said
order, hence, the appellant/landlord was not entitled for the
recovery of the possession of his property; (iii) in view of the
fact that the respondent eventually deposited the arrears of rent
his possession is required to be protected in view of section
12(3) and 13(5) of the Act.
14. We are of the opinion that all the reasons given by the
High Court are unsustainable in law.
The reasons which compelled the appellant to enter the
compromise are irrelevant for the issue at hand. The
respondent/judgment debtor cannot flout the compromise
decree with impunity on the ground that his opponent entered
the compromise in view of some serious dispute about the
maintainability of his claim. The conduct of the appellant in
entering the compromise only debars the appellant to recover
possession within the period of six months from the date of the
compromise decree whether the respondent paid the arrears
of rent or not till the last date. If the respondent paid the said
amount any time within the period of six months, the appellant
would be debarred from seeking the eviction of the respondent
on the cause of action which led to the filing of the eviction suit.
15. Coming to the second reason i.e., the failure of the
appellant to challenge the order of the executing court dated
23.11.2005 (by which the executing court granted 15 days time
to the respondent to deposit the balance of the arrears of rent)
debar the appellant to recover possession of the property in
dispute is equally untenable, because:
(i) in our opinion, the order of the executing court dated
23.11.2005 is beyond his jurisdiction and a nullity. The only
source which confers powers on the civil court to enlarge time
is found under Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure
which reads as follows:-
148. Enlargement of time
 Œ Where any period is fixed
or granted by the Court for the doing of any act prescribed
or allowed by this Code, the Court may, in its discretion,
from time to time, enlarge such period not exceeding thirty
days in total, even though the period originally fixed or
granted may have expired.

[J. CHELAMESW

It is obvious from the language of the Section, such a
power can be exercised only in a case where a period is fixed
or granted by the court for doing of any act prescribed by this
Court. In a compromise decree such as the one on hand, the
stipulation that the judgment debtor is required to make the
payment of the money within a specified period is a stipulation
by agreement between the parties and it is not a period fixed
by the court. Therefore, Section 148 CPC has no application
to such a situation. We are fortified by the decision of this court
in 
Hukumchand v. Bansilal and others
 
AIR 1968 SC 86
(ii) In our opinion, the order dated 23.11.2005 virtually
amounts to the modification of the decree and is without
jurisdiction on the part of the executing court, therefore, a nullity.
It is a settled principle of law that the executing court cannot
go beyond the decree. It has no jurisdiction to modify a decree.
It must execute the decree as it is. This Court in 
Deepa
Bhargava and Another v. Mahesh Bhargava and Others
[(2009) 2 SCC 294] held thus:-
ﬁ9. There is no doubt or dispute as regards interpretation
or application of the said consent terms. It is also not in
dispute that the respondent judgment-debtors did not act
in terms thereof. An executing court, it is well known, cannot
go behind the decree. It has no jurisdiction to modify a
decree. It must execute the decree as it is–.ﬂ
16. It is well settled that such a void order can create
neither legal rights nor obligations. Therefore, the appellant
cannot be denied his right to recover possession of the property
in dispute on the ground that he did not choose to challenge
such a void order.
17. The third reason of the High Court and the conclusion
of the executing court that the compromise decree insofar as it
provided for eviction of the tenant in the event of his failure to
pay the arrears of rent within a period of six months from the
decree is contrary to the provisions of the Act are interlinked.
Therefore, we are required to examine the scope of sections
12 and 13 of the Act insofar as they are relevant for the present
purpose.
18. Section 12(1) of the Act restricts the right of landlord
to evict his tenant only on the grounds enumerated in the said
section:
12. Restriction on eviction of tenants.Š (1) Notwithstanding
anything the contrary contained in any other law or contract,
no suit be filed in any civil court against a tenant for his
eviction from any accommodation except one of more of
the following grounds only, namelyŒ
19. The only ground urged by the appellant in his suit is
that the tenant fell in arrears of rent. Such a ground is one of
the grounds in section 12(1)(a) of the Act which enables the
landlord to evict the tenant if he could successfully establish that
the tenant did infact fall in arrears of rent and had neither
tendered nor paid the amount within the period specified under
Section 12(1)(a) despite a demand. Section 12(1)(a) reads as
follows:-
12(1)(a) that the tenant has neither paid nor tendered the
whole of the arrears of the rent legally recoverable from
him within two months of the date on which a notice of
demand for the arrears of rent has been served on him by
the landlord in the prescribed manner.ﬂ
20. Section 13(1)
2
 of the Act stipulates that the tenant shall

13. When tenant can get benefit of protection against eviction.Š(1) On a
suit or any other proceeding being instituted by a landlord in any of the
grounds referred to in section 12 or in any appeal or any of other proceeding
by a tenant against any decree or other for his eviction, the tenant shall,
within one month of the service of writ of summons or notice of any other
proceeding within one month of institution of appeal or any other proceeding
by the tenant as the case may be, or within such further time as the court
may on an application made to it allow in this behalf, deposit in the court

either deposit in the court or pay to the landlord an amount
calculated at the rate of rent at which it was prayed for by the
landlord for various periods specified therein (the details of
which are not necessary for the present). Such a deposit or
payment is required to be made in two contingencies. They
are:-
(i) upon institution of the suit for eviction of the tenant
irrespective of the ground on which eviction is sought; or
(ii) in an appeal or in a proceeding by the tenant against
the decree or order of eviction.
It is further stipulated that such a deposit or payment is required
to be made within a period of one month of the service of the
summons, if the deposit is being made during the pendency
of the suit or within a period of one month from the date of
institution of appeal or other proceeding as the case may be.
Further, the said sub-section also recognizes the authority of
the court to extend in its discretion the said period of one month
on an application made to it. Sub-section (2)
3
 provides for the
procedure in case of any dispute regarding the rate of rent
payable whereas sub-section (3) provides for the procedure to
be followed in case of any dispute regarding the person to
whom the rent is payable.
21. The submission that found favour with the executing
court is that in view of section 13.
ﬁ– the decree of the aforesaid Lok Adalat that in default
of payment of arrears of rent the judgment debtor shall be
liable to be evicted, cannot be enforced because
according to Section 13 of M.P. Accommodation Control
Act, if the judgment debtor pays the rent to the landlord
within one month from the date of issuance of summon or
within the stipulated time given by the court on an
application so made by the judgment debtor, then he will
be entitled for protection from eviction under Section 12
M.P. Accommodation Control Act, thus clearly entire
decreetal amount has been paid in the execution
proceeding, therefore, the judgment debtor shall be entitled
for protection from eviction.ﬂ
22. Sub-section (5)
4
 declares that if a tenant makes
deposit or payment as required under sub-section (1) or (2),
no decree or order for recovery of possession of the
accommodation can be passed. Sub-section (5) only protects
the defaulting tenant in possession in the event of his complying
with the requirement of Section 13(1) or (2) only in those cases
where the eviction is sought on the ground of arrears of rent
falling under section 12(1)(a).
23. The case of the appellant is one falling under section
12(1)(a) and, therefore, the learned counsel for the respondent
placed reliance on Section 13 (5) to sustain the conclusion of
the executing court. Section 13(5) reads as follows:-
ﬁ(5) If a tenant makes deposit or payment as required by
sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), no decree or order shall
or pay to the landlord, an amount calculated at the rate of rent at which it
was prayed, for the period for which the tenant may have made befault
including the period subsequent thereto up to the end of the month
previous to that in which the deposit or payment is made and shall
thereafter continue to deposit or pay, month by the 15th of each succeeding
month a sum equivalent to the rent at that rate till the decision of suit, appeal
or proceeding as the case may be.
3.
(2) If in any suit or proceeding referred to in sub-section (1) there is any
dispute as to amount of rent payable by the tenant, the court shall, on a
plea made either by landlord or tenant in that behalf which shall be taken
at the earliest opportunity during such suit or proceeding, fix a reasonable
provisional rent, in relation to the accommodation to be deposited or paid
in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1) and no court shall,
save for reasons to be recorded in writing, entertain any plea on this account
at subsequent stage.
4.
(5) If a tenant makes deposit or payment as required by sub-section (1) or
sub-section (2), on decree or order shall be made by the court for the
recovery of possession of the accommodation on the payment of rent by
the tenant, but the court may allow such cost as it may deem fit to the
landlord.

be made by the court for the recovery of possession of the
accommodation on the ground of default in the payment
of rent by the tenant, but the court may allow such cost as
it may deem fit to the landlord.ﬂ
24. A reading of Section 13, in our view clearly indicates
that the payment or the deposit of rent into the court by the
judgment debtor (tenant) is contemplated only during the
pendency of the suit for eviction or an appeal (by the tenant)
against a decree or order of eviction. Section 13 has no
application to the execution proceedings of a decree for
eviction.
25. The language of Section 13(1) is very clear and explicit
in this regard. We fail to understand as to how the Court could
read into Section 13, a possibility of enabling the judgment
debtor (tenant) to protect his possession by making the
payment during the execution proceedings in spite of the fact
that he had already been adjudged to be in default of payment
of the rent to the landlord. Such an interpretation of Section 13
would be wholly destructive of Section 12(1)(a). Therefore, not
only the language of Section 13(1), but also an irreconcilable
inconsistency that would arise between Section 12(1)(a) and
Section 13(1) if the interpretation placed by the executing court
is accepted - in our view is sufficient to hold that the executing
court™s interpretation of Section 13(1) is unsustainable.
26. Coming to the decision of this Court in
 Smt. Nai Bahu
v. Lala Ramnarayan and Others 
(1978) 1 SCC 58, all that this
Court held is that a landlord whose right to seek the eviction of
his tenant is restricted by a statute (to the grounds specified in
the statute) cannot successfully evict the tenant only on the
basis of a compromise decree passed in a suit for eviction of
the tenant. Apart from the consent of the tenant, one of the
statutorily stipulated grounds rendering the tenant liable for
eviction must necessarily exist for the validity of such a decree.
In other words, this court held that a tenant who suffered a
consent decree can still raise a question that none of the
statutory conditions existed which render him liable for eviction
when the consent decree came to be passed.
27. In the case on hand the tenant was clearly in arrears
of the rent which fact is acknowledged by the compromise
memo signed by the tenant which was incorporated in the
decree. Looked at any angle, we are not able to agree with the
judgment under appeal, nor able to sustain the executing court™s
order dismissing the landlord™s execution petition. The appeal
is accordingly allowed. The execution petition filed by the
appellant is also allowed. The executing court will now take
necessary steps for evicting the respondent from the disputed
premises and handing over the possession of the same to the
appellant.
28. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there will
be no order as to costs.

Workmen™s Compensation Act, 1923:
s.30, first proviso Œ Substantial question of law Œ Appeal
before High Court against order of Commissioner awarding
compensation Œ Held: In terms of the 1st proviso, no appeal
is maintainable against any order passed by Commissioner
unless a substantial question of law is involved Œ In the instant
case, High Court has neither referred to nor determined any
question of law much less a substantial question of law
existence whereof was a condition precedent for
maintainability of an appeal u/s 30 Š Inasmuch as the High
court remained oblivious of the basic requirement of law for
maintainability of an appeal before it and inasmuch as it
treated the appeal to be one on facts, it committed an error
which needs to be corrected.
Claim petition Œ Death of a driver Œ Commissioner
awarding compensation Œ High Court setting aside the award
holding that relationship of employer and employee was not
proved Œ Held: Commissioner had recorded a finding of fact
that deceased was employed as a driver by owner of vehicle
no matter the owner happened to be his brother Š That finding
could not be lightly interfered with or reversed by High Court
Š The order of High Court is set aside and that passed by
Commissioner restored.
A vehicle being driven by the appellant™s son collided
with another vehicle, resulting in his death. The
Commission for Workmen™s Compensation allowed a
compensation of Rs.4,48,000/-. However, the High Court
in the appeal filed by the insurer held that the relationship
between the deceased and his brother the owner of the
vehicle he was driving was not satisfactorily proved to
be that of an employee and an employer and that the only
remedy was by way of a claim for payment of
compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. In the
instant appeal filed by the mother of the deceased, it was
contended that since no substantial question of law was
involved in the case, High Court should not have
entertained the appeal in view of the provisions of s. 30
of the Workmen™s Compensation Act, 1923(rechristened
as Employee™s Compensation Act, 1923).
Allowing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 
1.1. In terms of the 1st proviso to s.30 of the
Workmen™s Compensation Act, 1923, no appeal is
maintainable against any order passed by the
Commissioner unless a substantial question of law is
involved. This necessarily implies that the High Court
would in the ordinary course formulate such a question
or at least address the same in the judgment especially
when it takes a view contrary to the view taken by the
Commissioner. [para 8] [41-D-F]
1.2. In the case at hand, the Commissioner for
Workmen™s Compensation had appraised the evidence
adduced before him and recorded a finding of fact that
the deceased was indeed employed as a driver by the
owner of the vehicle no matter the owner happened to
be his brother. That finding could not be lightly interfered
with or reversed by the High Court. The High Court
overlooked the fact that the respondent-owner of the
vehicle had appeared as a witness and clearly stated that
the deceased was his younger brother, but was working
as a paid driver under him. [para 9] [41-F-H]

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
T
.S. THAKUR, J.
 1. Leave granted.
2. The short question that falls for consideration in this
appeal is whether the High Court was justified in setting aside
the order passed by the Commissioner for Workmen™s
Compensation holding the appellant entitled to an amount of
Rs.4,48,000/- towards compensation with interest @ 12% per
annum.
3. The claim before the Commissioner arose out of a
motor accident in which the deceased-Prahlad lost his life while
driving a Toyota Qualis vehicle bearing registration No.KA-02/
C-423. The incident in question, it appears, occurred on 3rd
September 2000 near Bidadi Police Station, on the Bangalore-
Mysore highway involving a head on collision with a Tipper Lorry
bearing No.KA-02-B-9135. The deceased was removed to the
hospital where he died two days after the accident. A claim
petition was then filed before the Commissioner for Workmen™s
Compensation, Bangalore Sub-Division-IV, Bangalore by the
appellant, mother of the deceased for payment of
compensation. The claim petition alleged that the deceased
was employed as a driver on a monthly salary of Rs.6,000/- by
the owner of the vehicle. The vehicle being insured with the
respondent-company, the claimant sought recovery of the
amount from the company in terms of provisions of the
Workmen™s Compensation Act, 1923, now re-christened as the
Employee™s Compensation Act, 1923. The insurance company
contested the claim primarily on the ground that the jural
relationship of employer and employee did not exist between
the owner and the deceased. It was also contended that it was
the negligence of the deceased that had caused the accident
thereby disentitling the claimant to any compensation.
4. On the pleadings of the parties, the Commissioner
framed six issues for determination and eventually came to the
conclusion that the deceased was indeed working as a paid
1.3. The High Court has neither referred to nor
determined any question of law much less a substantial
question of law existence whereof was a condition
precedent for the maintainability of any appeal u/s 30.
Inasmuch as the High court remained oblivious of the
basic requirement of law for the maintainability of an
appeal before it and inasmuch as it treated the appeal to
be one on facts, it committed an error which needs to be
corrected. [para 10] [43-A-C]
1.4. Besides, the only reason which the High Court
has given to upset the finding of the Commissioner is that
the Commissioner could not blindly accept the oral
evidence without analysing the documentary evidence
on record. But it has not indicated as to what was the
documentary evidence which the Commissioner had
failed to appreciate and what was the contradiction, if
any, between such documents and the version given by
the witnesses examined before the Commissioner. The
High Court could not have, without adverting to the
documents vaguely referred to by it have upset the
finding of fact which the Commissioner was entitled to
record. [para 10] [42-F-H; 43-A]
1.5. The order of the High Court is set aside and that
passed by the Commissioner restored. [para 11]

driver of the owner of the vehicle, Toyota Qualis and that the
claimant, the appellant herein was entitled to receive an amount
of Rs.4,48,000/- towards compensation having regard to the
fact that the deceased was just about 20 years of age at the
time of accident and was receiving Rs.4,000/- per month
towards salary. An award for the said amount was accordingly
made by the Commissioner with interest @12% per annum
against the respondent-company who had admittedly
underwritten the risk in terms of a policy issued by it.
5. Aggrieved by the award made by the Commissioner,
the respondent-company preferred an appeal, M.F.A. No. 738
of 2009 before the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore which
has been allowed by a Single Judge of that Court in terms of
the order impugned order before us. The High Court was of the
view that the relationship between the deceased and his brother
the owner of the vehicle he was driving was not satisfactorily
proved to be that of an employee and an employer and that the
only remedy which the appellant, mother of the deceased had,
was by way of a claim for payment of compensation under the
Motor Vehicles Act.
6. Appearing for the appellant Mr. G.V. Chandrashekhar,
learned counsel, strenuously argued that the High Court was
in error in entertaining the appeal and in reversing the view
taken by the Commissioner by re-appraising the evidence on
record. He urged that the High Court remained oblivious of the
provisions of Section 30(1) of the Act which clearly stipulate that
no appeal shall lie against any order of the Commissioner
unless a substantial question of law fell for consideration. No
such question of law arose for consideration nor was the same
framed or addressed by the High Court in the course of the
judgment. The reasoning given by the High Court was,
according to the learned counsel, vague and based entirely on
surmises and conjectures hence unsustainable in law.
7. Section 30 of the Employees Compensation Act, 1923
no doubt provides for an appeal to the High Court from the
orders passed by the Commissioner and enumerated in
clauses (a) to (e) sub-Section (1) of Section 30. Proviso to
Section 30(1), however, makes it abundantly clear that no such
appeal shall lie unless a substantial question of law is involved
in the appeal and in the case of an order other than an order
such as is referred to in clause (b) unless the amount in dispute
in the appeal is not less than three hundred rupees. Section
30(1) reads as under:
ﬁ30. Appeals.Š
(1) An appeal shall lie to the High Court from the following
orders of a Commissioner, namely:Š
(a) an order as awarding as compensation a lump sum
whether by way of redemption of a half-monthly payment
or otherwise or disallowing a claim in full or in part for a
lump sum;
1[(aa) an order awarding interest or penalty under section
4A;]
(b) an order refusing to allow redemption of a half-
monthly payment;
(c) an order providing for the distribution of compensation
among the dependants of a deceased workman, or
disallowing any claim of a person alleging himself to be
such dependant;
(d) an order allowing or disallowing any claim for the
amount of an indemnity under the provisions of sub-
section (2) of section 12; or
(e) an order refusing to register a memorandum of
agreement or registering the same or providing for the
registration of the same subject to conditions:

Provided that no appeal shall lie against any order unless
a substantial question of law is involved in the appeal,
and in the case of an order other than an order such as
is referred to in clause (b), unless the amount in dispute
in the appeal is not less than three hundred rupees:
Provided further that no appeal shall lie in any case in
which the parties have agreed to abide by the decision
of the Commissioner, or in which the order of the
Commissioner gives effect to an agreement come to by
the parties:
Provided further that no appeal by an employer under
clause (a) shall lie unless the memorandum of appeal
is accompanied by a certificate by the Commissioner to
the effect that the appellant has deposited with him the
amount payable under the order appealed against.ﬂ
8. What is important is that in terms of the 1st proviso, no
appeal is maintainable against any order passed by the
Commissioner unless a substantial question of law is involved.
This necessarily implies that the High Court would in the
ordinary course formulate such a question or at least address
the same in the judgment especially when the High Court takes
a view contrary to the view taken by the Commissioner.
9. The Commissioner for Workmen™s Compensation had,
in the case at hand, appraised the evidence adduced before
him and recorded a finding of fact that the deceased was
indeed employed as a driver by the owner of the vehicle no
matter the owner happened to be his brother. That finding could
not be lightly interfered with or reversed by the High Court. The
High Court overlooked the fact that the respondent-owner of the
vehicle had appeared as a witness and clearly stated that the
deceased was his younger brother, but was working as a paid
driver under him. The Commissioner had, in this regard,
observed:
ﬁAfter examining the judgment of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court relied upon by 2nd opponent it is
seen that the owner of the vehicle being the sole witness
has been unsuccessful in establishing his case but in this
proceeding the owner of the vehicle has appeared before
this Court even though he is a relative of the deceased,
and has submitted in his objections, even evidence that
even though the deceased was his younger brother he
was working as a driver under him, and has admitted that
he was paying salary to him. The applicant in support of
his case has submitted Hon™ble High Court judgment
reported in ILR 2006 KAR 518. The Divisional Manager,
United India Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Yellappa
Bheemappa Alagudi & Ors. which I have examined in
depth which holds that there is no law that relatives cannot
be in employer employee relationship. Therefore it is no
possible to ignore the oral and documentary evidence
in favour of the applicant and such evidence has to be
weighed in favour of the applicant. For these reasons I
hold that the deceased was working as driver under first
opponent and driving Toyota Quails No.KA-02-C-423,
that he died in accident on 03.09.2005, that he is a
‚workman™ as defined in the Workmen™s Compensation
Act and it is held that he has caused accident in the
course of employment in a negligent fashion which has
resulted in his deathﬂ.
10. The only reason which the High Court has given to
upset the above finding of the Commissioner is that the
Commissioner could not blindly accept the oral evidence
without analysing the documentary evidence on record. We fail
to appreciate as to what was the documentary evidence which
the High Court had failed to appreciate and what was the
contradiction, if any, between such documents and the version
given by the witnesses examined before the Commissioner.

fact which the Commissioner was entitled to record. Suffice it
to say that apart from appreciation of evidence adduced before
the Commissioner the High Court has neither referred to nor
determined any question of law much less a substantial
question of law existence whereof was a condition precedent
for the maintainability of any appeal under Section 30. Inasmuch
as the High court remained oblivious of the basic requirement
of law for the maintainability of an appeal before it and inasmuch
as it treated the appeal to be one on facts it committed an error
which needs to be corrected.
11. We accordingly allow this appeal, set aside the order
of the High Court and restore that passed by the Commissioner.
We grant three months™ time to the respondent to deposit the
amount of compensation together with interest, if not already
paid or deposited failing which the appellant shall be free to

The plaintiff filed a suit for possession against the
defendants-respondents on the ground that they were
licensees occupying the premises gratuitously. It was the
case of the plaintiff that the predecessor-in-interest of the
defendants was allowed to occupy the suit premises as
a gratuitous licensee on humanitarian considerations.
After his demise, the defendants were served with a
notice terminating the licence and asking them to hand
over the possession of the suit premises, but they
refused to vacate and falsely claimed to be tenants. It was
alternatively urged that the plaintiff was entitled to
vacation of the premises, 
inter alia
, on the ground of bona
fide personal need. In the written statement filed by the
defendants they stuck to their version that the suit
property was occupied by their predecessor-in-interest
as a tenant and upon his demise they too were in
occupation of the same as tenants. The trial court
dismissed the suit. But, the first appellate court decreed
the suit. However, the High Court allowed the second
appeal of the defendants-respondents holding that the
plaintiff™s case that the predecessor-in-interest of the
defendants was a gratuitous licensee was incompatible
with the plea that he was a tenant and, therefore, could
be evicted under the Rent Act.
Allowing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 1.1. Whether or not the defendants were
licensees as alleged by the plaintiff was essentially a
question of fact and had to be answered on the basis of
the evidence on record which the first appellate court had
reappraised to hold that the defendants were let into the
suit property by the plaintiff on humanitarian grounds and
as gratuitous licensees, and licence stood validly
terminated. The defence of the defendants-respondents
that they were occupying the premises as tenants was
held by the first appellate court not proved. The High
Court could not have interfered with that finding of fact.
[Para 10] [52-A-D, G]
1.2. The alternative plea would be redundant if the
plaintiff™s case of the defendants being gratuitous
licensees was accepted by the court. That is precisely
what had happened in the instant case. The first appellate
court accepted the plaintiff™s case that defendants were
in occupation as licensees and not as tenants. The High
Court has not set aside that finding of fact on its merits.
Without finding fault with the findings recorded by the
first appellate court on the question of license and its
termination, the High Court has dismissed the suit simply
because the plea of tenancy was, in its opinion,
contradictory to the plea of license set up in the earlier
part of the plaint. That was not a proper approach or
course to follow. Therefore, the order passed by the High
Court cannot be sustained. [Para 11-12] [53-B-C, E-G]
2.1. As regards the inconsistent pleas, the plaintiff-
appellant in the case at hand had set up a specific case
that the defendant as also his legal representatives after
his demise were occupying the suit premises as
licensees which licence had been validly terminated. In
reply to the notice the case of the defendants was that
they were in occupation of the suit premises not as
licensees but as tenants. The plaintiff was, therefore,
entitled on that basis alone to ask for an alternative relief
of a decree for eviction on the grounds permissible under
the Rent Control Act. The written statement filed by the
defendant contained an express admission of the fact
that the property belonged to the plaintiff and that the
defendants were in occupation thereof as tenants. In the
trial court also the question whether the defendants were
in occupation as licensee or as tenants had been
specifically put in issue thereby giving the fullest
opportunity to the parties to prove their respective cases.

1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal arises out of a judgment and order dated
16th October, 2009 passed by the High Court of Judicature at
Bombay whereby the High Court has allowed Civil Second
Appeal No.90 of 1992 set aside the judgment and decree
passed by the Additional District Judge in Civil Appeal No.33
of 1987 and restored that passed by the Trial Court dismissing
Regular Civil Suit No.87 of 1984. The factual backdrop in which
the dispute arose may be summarized as under:
3. Manohar Narayan Rele owned a house bearing
Panchayat No.105 situate in village Ravdanda, Taluka Alibag,
District Raigad, in the State of Maharashtra. In RCS No.87 of
1984 filed by the said Shri Rele before the Civil Judge (Junior
Division), Alibag, the plaintiff prayed for a decree for
possession of the suit premises comprising a part of the house
mentioned above on the ground that the defendants who
happened to be the legal heirs of one Shri Narayan Keshav
Ghosalkar, a Goldsmith by profession, residing in Bombay was
allowed to occupy the suit premises as a gratuitous licensee
on humanitarian considerations without any return,
compensation, fee or charges for such occupation. Upon the
demise of Shri Narayan Keshav Ghosalkar in February 1978,
the defendants who stepped into his shoes as legal heirs
started abusing the confidence reposed by the plaintiff in the
said Ghosalkar and creating nuisance and annoyance to the
There was no question of the defendants being taken by
surprise by the alternative case pleaded by the plaintiff
nor could any injustice result from the alternative plea
being allowed and tried by the court. [Para 18] [57-A-E]

causing nuisance and annoyance to the plaintiff and damage
to the property were also held against the plaintiff by the Trial
Court while declining relief to the plaintiff.
7. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree passed by the
Trial Court, the plaintiff preferred Civil Appeal No.33 of 1987
before the Additional District Judge, Alibag who formulated six
points for determination and while allowing the appeal filed by
the plaintiff decreed the suit in favour of his legal representatives
as the original plaintiff had passed away in the meantime. The
First Appellate Court held that the plaintiff had successfully
established that the suit premises was occupied by Shri
Narayan Keshav Ghosalkar on gratuitous and humanitarian
grounds. It also held that the defendants-respondents had failed
to prove the existence of any tenancy in their favour and that
since the license granted to the defendants had been validly
terminated, the legal heirs substituted in place of the original
plaintiff were entitled to a decree.
8. Second appeal No.90 of 1992 was then filed by the
respondent against the judgment of the First Appellate Court
before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay which was
allowed by a Single Judge of that Court in terms of its judgment
impugned in the present appeal. Apart from three substantial
questions of law which the High Court had formulated for
consideration, it framed a fourth question for consideration
which was to the following effect:
ﬁWhether the plaintiff could raise two contradictory pleas
in the plaint, namely, that (i) the defendants were
permitted to occupy the suit premises gratis; and (ii) that
the defendants should be evicted from the suit premises
under the provisions of the Bombay Rent Act?ﬂ
9. Significantly, the decision rendered by the High Court
plaintiff with the result that the plaintiff was forced to terminate
the licence granted by him in terms of a notice assuring for
delivery of vacant possession of the premises w.e.f. 1st
February, 1984. Upon receipt of the notice, the defendants
instead of complying with the same sent a reply refusing to
vacate the premises on the false plea that they were occupying
the same as tenants since the time of Shri Narayan Keshav
Ghosalkar and were paying rent although the plaintiff had never
issued any receipt acknowledging such payment. In a rejoinder
sent to the defendants, the plaintiff denied the allegations made
by the defendants and by way of abundant caution claimed
possession of the suit premises even on the grounds permitted
under the Rent Control Act of course without prejudice to his
contention that the defendants could not seek protection under
the Rent Act. Time for vacation of the premises was also
extended by the said rejoinder upto the end of April, 1984.
4. The defendants did not vacate the premises thereby
forcing the plaintiff to file a suit for possession against them
on the ground that they were licensees occupying the premises
gratuitously and out of humanitarian considerations. It was
alternatively urged that the plaintiff was entitled to vacation of
the premises on the ground of bona fide personal need,
nuisance, annoyance and damage allegedly caused to the
premise and to the adjoining garden land belonging to him.
5. In the written statement filed by the defendants they
stuck to their version that the suit property was occupied by
Shri Narayan Keshav Ghosalkar as a tenant and upon his
demise the defendants too were in occupation of the same as
tenants.
6. On the pleadings of the parties the Trial Court framed
as many as eight issues and eventually dismissed the suit
holding that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the defendants
were gratuitous licensees. The Trial Court also held that the
defendants had proved that they were occupying the premises

rests entirely on the fourth question extracted above. The High
Court has taken the view that while the plaintiff could indeed
seek relief in the alternative, the contentions raised by him were
not in the alternative but contradictory, hence, could not be
allowed to be urged. The High Court found that the plaintiff™s
case that the defendant was a gratuitous licensee was
incompatible with the plea that he was a tenant and, therefore,
could be evicted under the Rent Act. The High Court observed:
ﬁIt is now well settled that a plaintiff may seek reliefs in
the alternative but in fact the pleadings are mutually
opposite, such pleas cannot be raised by the plaintiff.
There is an essential difference between contradictory
pleas and alternative pleas. When the plaintiff claims
relief in the alternative, the cause of action for the reliefs
claimed is the same. However, when contradictory pleas
are raised, such as in the present case, the foundation
for these contradictory pleas is not the same. When the
plaintiff proceeds on the footing that the defendant is a
gratuitous licensee, he would have to establish that no
rent or consideration was paid for the premises. Whereas,
if he seeks to evict the defendant under the Rent Act, the
plaintiff accepts that the defendant is in possession of
the premises as a tenant and liable to pay rent. Thus,
the issue whether rent is being paid becomes
fundamental to the decision. Therefore, in my opinion,
the pleas that the defendant is occupying the suit
premises gratuitously is not compatible with the plea that
the defendant is a tenant and therefore can be evicted
under the Rent Act.ﬂ
10. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at
length. The case of the plaintiff appellant herein primarily was
that the original defendant and even his legal representatives
were occupying the suit premises as gratuitous licensees upon
termination whereof the plaintiff was entitled to a decree for
possession. While the Trial Court found that the defendants
were tenants and not licensees as alleged by the plaintiff the
First Appellate Court had recorded a clear finding to the
contrary holding that the defendants were indeed occupying the
premises as licensees whose license was validly terminated
by the plaintiff. Whether or not the defendants were licensees
as alleged by the plaintiff was essentially a question of fact and
had to be answered on the basis of the evidence on record
which the First Appellate Court had reappraised to hold that
the defendants were let into the suit property by the plaintiff on
humanitarian grounds and as gratuitous licensees. Absence of
any rent note evidencing payment of rent or any other material
or circumstance to suggest that the relationship between the
parties was that of landlord and tenant, abundantly supported
the conclusion of the First Appellate Court. That finding also
negatived the defence of the defendants-respondents that they
were occupying the premises as tenants which assertion of the
defendant-respondent was held not proved by the First
Appellate Court. There is no gainsaid that while considering the
question whether the relationship between the parties was that
of licensor and licensee as alleged by the plaintiff or landlord
and tenant as asserted by the defendants, the First Appellate
Court took into consideration the totality of the evidence on
record with a view to finding out as to which of the two versions
was factually correct. That doubtless was the correct approach
to adopt in a suit based on an alleged license where the
defendant™s logical defence was bound to be that he is in
occupation not as a licensee but as a tenant. There was, in that
view, nothing special or novel about the plea raised in defence
by the defendants-respondents. What is important is that the
First Appellate Court on facts found that the defendants and
even their predecessor were licensees in the premises which
stood validly terminated. The High Court could not have
interfered with that finding of fact leave alone on the ground that
since the alternative case set up by the plaintiff in the plaint was
contradictory to the primary case pleaded by him, he was
entitled to relief even on proof of the primary case.

11. That apart the alternative plea of the plaintiff and the
defence set up by the defendants was no different from each
other. The only question that would fall for determination based
on such a plea was whether the plaintiff had made out a case
on the grounds permissible under the Rent Control Act. An
adjudication on that aspect would become necessary only if the
plaintiff did not succeed on the primary case set up by him. The
alternative plea would be redundant if the plaintiff™s case of the
defendants being gratuitous licenses was accepted by the
Court. That is precisely what had happened in the instant case.
The First Appellate Court accepted the plaintiff™s case that
defendants were in occupation as licensees and not as tenants.
The High Court has not set aside that finding of fact on its
merits. It may have been a different matter if the High Court had
done so for valid reasons and then declined to entertain the
alternative case set up by the plaintiff based on tenancy. One
could in that case perhaps argue that the Court had declined
to go beyond the principal contention to examine the alternative
plea which was contradictory to the principal plea. That,
however, is not what the High Court has done. Without finding
fault with the findings recorded by the First Appellate Court on
the question of a license and its termination the High Court has
dismissed the suit simply because the plea of tenancy was, in
its opinion, contradictory to the plea of license set up in the
earlier part of the plaint. That was not, in our opinion, a proper
approach or course to follow.
12. The upshot of the above discussion is that the order
passed by the High Court cannot be sustained. Having said that
we may deal with the question whether the plea of license and
tenancy could be together urged by the plaintiff for grant of relief
in a suit for possession.
13. The general rule regarding inconsistent pleas raised
in the alternative is settled by a long line of decisions rendered
by this Court. One of the earliest decisions on the subject was
rendered by this Court in 
Srinivas Ram Kumar v. Mahabir
Prasad and Ors. AIR 1951 SC 177,
 where this Court
observed:
ﬁIt is true that it was no part of the plaintiff™s case as made
in the plaint that the sum of Rs. 30,000 was advanced
by way of loan to the defendant second party. But it was
certainly open to the plaintiff to make an alternative case
to that effect and make a prayer in the alternative for a
decree for money even if the allegations of the money
being paid in pursuance of a contract of sale could not
be established by evidence. The fact that such a prayer
would have been inconsistent with the other prayer is not
really material–An Appellant may rely upon different
rights alternatively and there is nothing in the Civil
Procedure Code to prevent a party from making two or
more inconsistent sets of allegations and claiming relief
thereunder in the alternative.ﬂ
14. In 
Bhagwati Prasad v. Chandramaul 
AIR 1966 SC 735
the plea of licence was accepted against the plea of tenancy
although the plea of licence was not set up by the appellant.
The appellant in that case contended that the land and the
construction over the land belonged to him and that he had let
the constructed portion to the respondent on a monthly rental
basis. The respondent, however, alleged that although the land
belonged to the appellant the building standing over the same
was constructed by the respondent out of his own money and,
therefore, he was entitled to occupy the same till his money was
recovered from the appellant. Since the plea of tenancy set up
by the appellant could not be proved, the Court held that the
respondent was staying in the house with the leave and licence
of the appellant. What is important is that the Court clearly
recognised the principle that if the plea raised by the tenant in
his written statement was clear and unambiguous in a suit
where one party alleged the relationship between the two to be
that of licensor and licensee, while the other alleged the
existence of a tenancy, only two issues arose for determination,

namely, whether the defendant is tenant of the plaintiff or is
holding the property as a licensee. If the Court comes to the
conclusion after the parties lead their evidence that the tenancy
had not been proved then the only logical inference was that
the defendant was in possession of the property as a licensee.
This Court said:
ﬁIn such a case the relationship between the parties would
be either that of a landlord and tenant, or that of an owner
of property and a person put into possession if it by the
owner™s license. No other alternative is logically or
legitimately possible. 
When parties led evidence in this
case, clearly they were conscious of this position, and so,
when the High Court came to the conclusion that the
tenancy had not been proved, but the defendant™s
argument also had not been established, it clearly
followed that the defendant was in possession of the suit
premises by the leave and license of the
plaintiff
–––––––––––––..
In our opinion, having regard to the pleas taken by the
defendant in his written statement in clear and
unambiguous language, only two issues could arise
between the parties: 
is the defendant the tenant of the
plaintiff, or is he holding the property as the license
,subject to the terms specified by the written statement?....
we are unable to see any error of law in the approach by
the High Court in dealing with it.ﬂ
(emphasis supplied)
15. In 
G. Nagamma and Anr. v. Siromenamma and Anr.
(1996) 2 SCC 25, this Court held that the plaintiff was entitled
to plead even inconsistent pleas especially when, they are
seeking alternative reliefs.
16. To the same effect is the decision of this Court in 
B.K.
Narayana Pillai v. Parameswaran Pillai
 
2000(1) SCC 712. In
that case the appellant-defendant wanted to amend the written
statement by taking a plea that in case he is not held to be a
lessee, he was entitled to the benefit of Section 60(b) of the
Indian Easements Act, 1882. Allowing the amendment this
Court held that the plea sought to be raised was neither
inconsistent nor repugnant to the pleas raised in defence. The
Court further declared that there was no absolute bar against
taking of inconsistent pleas by a party. What is impermissible
is taking of an inconsistent plea by way of an amendment
thereby denying the other side the benefit of an admission
contained in the earlier pleadings. In cases where there was
no inconsistency in the facts alleged a party is not prohibited
from taking alternative pleas available in law.
17. Reference may also be made to the decision of this
Court in 
J.J. Lal Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. v. M.R. Murali and Anr.
(2002) 3 SCC 98 where this Court formulated the following
tests for determining whether the alternative plea raised by the
plaintiff was permissible:
ﬁTo sum up the gist of holding in 
Firm Sriniwas Ram
Kumar™s case
: If the facts stated and pleading raised in
the written statement, though by 
way of defence to the
case of the plaintiff, are such which could have
 entitled
the plaintiff to a relief in the alternative, the plaintiff may
rely on such pleading of the defendant and claim an
alternate decree based thereon subject to four conditions
being satisfied, viz., (i) the statement of case by defendant
in his written statement amounts to an express admission
of the facts entitling the plaintiff to an alternative relief,
(ii) in granting such relief the defendant is not taken by
surprise, (iii) no injustice can possibly result to the
defendant, and (iv) though the plaintiff would have been
entitled to the same relief in a separate suit the interest
of justice demand the plaintiff not being driven to the
need of filing another suit.ﬂ

appellate Court had granted relief to the appellant not in relation
to the alternative plea raised by him but on the principal case
set up by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff succeeded on the principal
case set up by him whether or not the alternative plea was
contradictory or inconsistent or even destructive of the original
plea paled into insignificance.
19. In the result, this appeal succeeds and is, hereby
allowed, the impugned judgment passed by the High Court is
set aside and that passed by the first appellate Court is
restored. The respondents are granted time till 30th April 2014
to vacate the premises subject to their filing undertakings on
usual terms before this Court within six weeks from today. In
case the undertakings are not filed, as directed, the decree
passed in favour of the appellant shall become executable
forthwith. No costs.
R.P.
Appeal allowed.
18. The plaintiff-appellant in the case at hand had set up
a specific case that the defendant as also his legal
representative after his demise were occupying the suit
premises as licensees which licence had been validly
terminated. In the reply to the notice the case of the defendants
was that were in occupation of the suit premises not as
licensees but as tenants. The plaintiff was, therefore, entitled
on that basis alone to ask for an alternative relief of a decree
for eviction on the grounds permissible under the Rent Control
Act. Such an alternative plea did not fall foul if any of the
requirements/tests set out in the decision of this Court in 
J.J.
Lal™s 
case (supra). We say so because the written statement
filed by the defendant contained an express admission of the
fact that the property belonged to the plaintiff and that the
defendants were in occupation thereof as tenants. At the trial
Court also the question whether the defendants were in
occupation as licencee or as tenants had been specifically put
in issue thereby giving the fullest opportunity to the parties to
prove their respective cases. There was no question of the
defendants being taken by surprise by the alternative case
pleaded by the plaintiff nor could any injustice result from the
alternative plea being allowed and tried by the Court. As a
matter of fact the trial Court had without any demurrer gone into
the merits of the alternative plea and dismissed the suit on the
ground that the plaintiff had not been able to prove a case for
eviction of the defendants. There was thus not only a proper
trial on all those grounds urged by the plaintiff but also a
judgment in favour of the defendant respondents. Last but not
the least even if the alternative plea had not been allowed to
be raised in the suit filed by the appellant he would have been
certainly entitled to raise that plea and seek eviction in a
separate suit filed on the very same grounds. The only
difference may have been that the suit may have then been filed
before the Court of Small Causes but no error of jurisdiction
was committed in the instant case as the finding recorded by
the Civil Court was that the defendants were licensees and not
tenants. Superadded to all these factors is the fact that the

and removal from service for the two charges levelled
against him shocks the judicial conscience of this Court.
It has not been established that the appellant had, as a
matter of habit or on a wide scale, made illegal demands
from Railway servants desirous of obtaining a Fit
Certificate. However, since two of the three charges have
been proved, this Court is of the considered opinion that
the imposition of compulsory retirement i.e. Penalty 6(vii)
of Part III of The Railway Servants (Discipline and Appeal)
Rules, 1968 would have better and more appropriately
met the ends of justice. Deprivation of retiral benefits in
addition to loss of service is entirely incommensurate
with the charge of the appellant having taken very small
sums of money for the issuance of Fit Certificate to other
Railway employees. The impugned order dated
11.10.2010 is set aside. The appellant shall be deemed to
have compulsorily retired under Part-III Penalty 6(vii) of

entitled to retiral or other benefits as on the said date.

come to the conclusion that the President had decided the
Revision in accordance with law.
4. 
In these proceedings, learned counsel for the Appellant
has confined his arguments to the ground Œ ﬁwhether the
punishment of removal of service of the petitioner on the alleged
demand of meagre amount of Rs.18-45 is contrary to the
doctrine of proportionalityﬂ.
5. 
It is now well settled that it is open to the Court, in all
circumstances, to consider whether the punishment imposed
on the delinquent workman or officer, as the case may be, is
commensurate with the Articles of Charge levelled against him.
There is a deluge of decisions on this question and we do not
propose to travel beyond Union of India v. S.S. Ahluwalia
(2007) 7 SCC 257 in which this Court had held that if the
conscience of the Court is shocked as to the severity or
inappropriateness of the punishment imposed, it can remand
the matter back for fresh consideration to the Disciplinary
Authority concerned. In that case, the punishment that had been
imposed was the deduction of 10% from the pension for a
period of one year. The High Court had set aside that order. In
those premises, this Court did not think it expedient to remand
the matter back to the Disciplinary Authority and instead
approved the decision of the High Court.
6. 
The Appellant before us is presently 75 years of age.
At the time when the Articles of Charge had been served upon
him, he had already given the best part of his life to the service
of the Respondent-Indian Railways. It has been contended
before us that the three charges that have been sustained
against the Appellant reflected only the tip of the iceberg;
however, there is no material on record to substantiate this
argument of Respondents. In the present case, the Appellant
has served the Respondents for a period of twenty three years
and removal from service for the two charges levelled against
him shocks our judicial conscience. Part III of The Railway
Servants (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1968 contains the
38190 of 2004 and order 11.10.2010 in Civil Misc. Writ Petition

assail the Judgment dated 11.10.2010 of the Division Bench
of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Civil Misc. Writ
Petition No.38190 of 2004 as well as the subsequent Order
dated 28.3.2012 by which a Review Application in respect of
the former was dismissed.
2. 
The Division Bench was confronted with the dismissal
from service of the Appellant Dr. Ishwar Chandra Jayaswal
against whom three Articles of Charge had been framed.
Article-I was that he demanded and accepted a sum of Rs.26/
- from Shri Pyare Ram, Khalasi for issuing in his favour a Fit
Certificate. Article-II, in similar vein was that the Appellant
demanded and accepted a sum of Rs.34/- from Shri Nandlal,
Semi-skilled Revetter for issuing him a Fit Certificate. Article-
III was that the Appellant had demanded and accepted Rs.18/
- from Shri Balroop, Semi-skilled Revetter for issuing of Fit
Certificate. The Inquiry Officer, after duly perusing the entire
evidence, returned a finding that Charges 1 and 3 had been
proved. The Disciplinary Authority, after considering the
response of the Appellant, by its Order dated 22.1.1991
imposed the penalty of removal of the Appellant from service.

However, since two of the three charges have been proved, we
are of the considered opinion that the imposition of compulsory
retirement i.e. Penalty 6(vii) would have better and more
appropriately met the ends of justice. While this would have
instilled sufficient degree of fear in the mind of the employees,
it would also not have set at naught several years of service
which the Appellant had already given to the Respondent-Indian
Railways. We think that deprivation of retiral benefits in addition
to loss of service is entirely incommensurate with the charge
of the Appellant having taken very small sums of money for the
issuance of Fit Certificate to other Railway employees.
7. 
It is in these premises that the Appeals are accepted
and the impugned Order dated 11.10.2010 is set aside. The
Appellant shall be deemed to have compulsorily retired under
Part-III Penalty 6(vii) of the aforementioned Railway Rules with
effect from 22.1.1991. If he is entitled to retiral or other benefits
on the said date, the Respondents shall make necessary
payment within three months from today. This decision is
restricted to the facts of the present case.

v
. BAPU CONSTRUCTION
However, order of High Court modified and appellant directed
to furnish security for entire award amount Š Interpretation of
statutes Œ Restrictive construction Œ Constitution of India, 1950
Œ Art. 12.
The appellant-Jal Sansthan filed an appeal before the
High Court challenging the order of the District Judge
whereby he rejected its objection u/s 34 of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996. The appellant filed an appeal
before the High Court. In the application for stay, the High
Court directed the Jal Sansthan to deposit the entire
amount awarded by the arbitrator permitting the claimant-
respondent to withdraw half of the said amount without
furnishing security and remaining half on furnishing
security.
In the instant appeal filed by the Jal Sansthan, it was
contended for the appellant that the High Court fell into
error by directing deposit of entire award amount and
release of the same in favour of the claimant-respondent
applying the principle of O. 41, r. 5 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908, though the said principle was not
applicable to the appellant which was an extended wing
of the State. It was submitted that the principle of O. 41,
r. 5, CPC were to be read in harmony with O. 27, r. 8A,
CPC and on such harmonious reading it would be clear
that such a condition could not have been imposed on a
governmental organization.
Disposing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 1.1. Sections 35 and 36 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996, make it clear that the award
becomes enforceable when the time for making the
application to set aside the arbitral award has expired or
having been filed it has been refused and further that it
is enforceable in the same manner as if it were a decree
of the court. Thus, the award has the potentiality of
enforcement. Therefore, when an appeal is filed against
the rejection of the objection preferred u/s 34 of the Act,
the enforceability of the award gains absolute ground. If
an application for stay has to be filed, it has to be filed
relating to stay of the operation of the award passed by
the arbitrator. The court rejecting the objection only
refuses to entertain the objection and thereafter, the
award becomes enforceable as if it were a decree.
Whatever may be the status of the award under the Act,
in respect of any other statute, but when it is challenged
in an appeal u/s 37 of the Act, the underlying principle of
the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable. [Para 9 and 14]

1.2. O.41, r. 5, CPC is applicable to an appeal
preferred before the High Court, for there is no provision
in the Act prohibiting the appellate court not to take
recourse to the underlying principles of the Code of Civil
Procedure as long as they are in consonance with the
spirit and principles engrafted under the Act. [Para 15]

2.1. The legislature has used the word ﬁGovernmentﬂ
in O.27, r. 8A and defined the same in O.27, r. 8B. The
intention is absolutely clear and unambiguous. It means
the ﬁGovernmentﬂ in exclusivity. From the language
employed in O. 27, rr 8A and 8B, it only means the
ﬁGovernmentﬂ. In fact, r. 8B clearly states ﬁin relation to

any suit by or against the Central Government or against
a public officer in the service of the Governmentﬂ and
similar language is used for the State Government.
Therefore, the legislature has deliberately used a
restrictive definition and its scope cannot be expanded
to cover an agency or instrumentality of the State by
interpretative process. The legislature has defined the
term ﬁGovernmentﬂ so as not to allow any room for
interpretation and speculation. It means either a Central
Government or a State Government and in certain cases
public officer in the service of a State. O. 27, rr. 8A and
8B are applicable only to the Government and not to
instrumentality or agency of the State. Thus, it cannot be
accepted that the appellant being a Jal Sansthan it would
come within the extended wing of the Government. [Para

by an ﬁExecutive Governmentﬂ. An authority or
instrumentality of the State or agency of the State has to
act in a fair, non-arbitrary and reasonable manner and, in
fact, is controlled by Chapter III of the Constitution but it
does not assume the character of ﬁGovernmentﬂ for all
purposes. [Para 27 and 29] [84-F-G; 86-B-C]

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 26
of 2014.
From the Judgment & Order dated 17.07.2013 of the High
Court of Judicature at Allahabad in FAFO No. 875 of 2013.
Shail Kumar Dwivedi, Gunnam Venkateswara Rao,
Siddharth Krishna Dwivedi for the Appellants.
Pradeep Kumar Yadav, P.J. Malkan, Amit Kumar Yadav
and Purvish, Jitendra Malkan for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
DIP
AK MISRA, J.
 1. 
Leave granted.
2. Calling in question the defensibility of the order dated
17.7.2013 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad
in FAFO No. 875 of 2013 whereby the Division Bench, after
admitting the appeal, while dealing with the application for stay,
directed the appellants to deposit the entire amount awarded
by the arbitrator in the court below with a further direction
permitting the claimant-respondent to withdraw half of the said
amount without furnishing security and remaining half after
furnishing security to the satisfaction of the District Judge,
Kanpur with a further stipulation that in case of default in making
the deposit, the order of stay shall automatically stand vacated.
3. The essential facts which are to be stated for
adjudication of this appeal are that an agreement was executed
between Kanpur Jal Sansthan, the appellant herein, with the
respondent, M/s. Bapu Construction, on 10.06.1987 for ﬁsupply
of sand for slow sand filterﬂ for a value of Rs.21,43,200/-. As
per the conditions contained in the agreement the work was to
commence 23.5.1987 and was to be completed within one
year. During the subsistence of the contract disputes arose
between the parties as a consequence of which the respondent
moved an application under Section 11(5) and (6) of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for brevity ﬁthe Actﬂ) for
appointment of an arbitrator. After the learned Arbitrator was
appointed, he proceeded with the arbitration and, eventually,
passed an award on 20.1.2009 allowing the claim of the
respondent by awarding a total sum of Rs.32,62,415.30 with a
further stipulation that the said sum shall carry interest at the
rate of 18% per annum from the year 1988. The appellant
herein filed an objection under Section 34 of the Act to set
aside the award dated 20.1.2009 in Arbitration Petition No. 32
of 2003 on many a ground. The learned District Judge, Kanpur,
vide order dated 30.3.2013, rejected the application which was
the subject-matter of Misc. Case No. 40/70 of 2009.
4. The failure in sustaining the objection before the learned
District Judge compelled the appellant to file FAFO No. 875
of 2013 before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. Along
with the appeal an application for stay was filed. The Division
Bench passed an interim order, as has been mentioned
hereinbefore.
5. We have heard Mr. Shail Kumar Dwivedi, learned
counsel appearing for the appellants and Mr. Pradeep Kumar
Yadav, learned counsel appearing for the respondent.
6. Criticizing the justifiability of the order, Mr. Dwivedi,
learned counsel for the appellant, has submitted that the Division
Bench has fallen into error by directing deposit of entire award
amount and release of the same in favour of the claimant-
respondent applying the principle of Order XLI Rule 5 of the
Code of Civil Procedure though the said principle is not

applicable to the appellant which is an extended wing of the
State. It is urged by him that the Division Bench has failed to
analyse the merits of the case, namely, the enormous delay in
filing the application for appointment of an arbitrator, nature of
claims which are absolutely stale and that apart, how the award
is flagrantly violative of public policy. It is further urged by him
that the principle of Order XLI Rule 5 of the Code has to be
read in harmony with Order XXVII Rule 8A of the Code and on
such harmonious reading it is clear as sunshine that such a
condition is not likely to be imposed on a governmental
organization. To buttress his submission he has commended
us to the decision in 
State of Kerala v. Kuruvilla.
1
7. Mr. Yadav, learned counsel appearing for the
respondent, resisting the aforesaid submissions, contended that
after the objection preferred under Section 34 of the Act has
been rejected, the award passed by the learned Arbitrator
becomes executable by itself and, therefore, it has the status
of a money decree and hence, the Division Bench has correctly
imposed the conditions and, therefore, no fault can be found
with the said order. It is contended by him that Order XLI Rule
5 and Order XXVII Rule 8A should be kept in different
compartments failing which the decree holder would not be
able to realize the fruits the decree for a considerable length
of time and eventually it may become a paper tiger. He has
drawn inspiration from the decision in 
Sihor Nagar Palika
Bureau v. Bhabhlubhai Virabhai & Co.
2
 
to highlight that this
Court had applied the principle behind Order XLI Rule 5 to a
municipality and a ﬁJal Sansthanﬂ does not enjoy a better status
than a municipality.
8. To appreciate the rivalised submissions raised at the
Bar we think it apt to refer to the Scheme of the Act. Under the
Act, after the award is passed by the arbitrator, an application
for setting aside the arbitral award is permissible under
Chapter VII relating to arbitration under Part I. Chapter VIII
occurring in Part I provides about the finality and enforcement
of arbitral awards. Sections 35 and 36 which occur in this
Chapter are reproduced below: -
ﬁ
35. Finality of arbitral awards
. Œ Subject to this Part an
arbitral award shall be final and binding on the parties and
persons claiming under them respectively.
36. Enforcement
. Œ Where the time for making an
application to set aside the arbitral award under Section
34 has expired, or such application having been made, it
has been refused, the award shall be enforced under the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) in the same
manner as if it were a decree of the Court.ﬂ
9. On a reading of both the provisions it is clear as day
that the award becomes enforceable when the time for making
the application to set aside the arbitral award has expired or
having been filed it has been refused and further it is
enforceable in the same manner as if it were a decree of the
Court. Thus, the award has the potentiality of enforcement.
Hence, when an appeal is filed against the rejection of the
objection preferred under Section 34 of the Act, the
enforceability of the award gains absolute ground. If an
application for stay has to be filed, it has to be filed relating to
stay of the operation of the award passed by the arbitrator. We
are disposed to think so as the court rejecting the objection only
refuses to entertain the objection and thereafter the award
becomes enforceable as if it were a decree. In the present
case, it is not clear whether there was prayer for stay of the
award. However, we treat it as if there was a prayer for stay of
the award and proceed accordingly.
10. At this juncture, we may refer with profit to Section 19
of the Act which occurs in Chapter V of the Act that deals with
conduct of arbitral proceedings. It provides for determination
of rules of procedure. It reads as follows: -

ﬁ
19. Determination of rules of procedure
. Œ (1) The
arbitral tribunal shall not be bound by the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) or the Indian Evidence Act,
1872 (1 of 1872).
(2) Subject to this Part, the parties are free to agree
on the procedure to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in
conducting its proceedings.
(3) Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section
(2), the arbitral tribunal may, subject to this Part, conduct
the proceedings in the manner it considers appropriate.
(4) The power of the arbitral tribunal under sub-
section (3) includes the power to determine the
admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any
evidence.ﬂ
11. Section 2(e) of the Act defines ﬁCourtﬂ to mean the
principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district and
includes the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil
jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming
the subject-matter of arbitration if the same has been the
subject-matter of a suit but does not include any Civil Court of
a grade inferior to such principal Civil Court or any Court of
Small Causes.
12. Section 37 of the Act deals with appealable orders.
For the sake of completeness it is reproduced below: -
ﬁ
37. Appealable orders
. Œ (1) An appeal shall lie from the
following orders (and from no others) to the Court
authorized by law to hear appeals from original decrees
of the Court passing the order, namely: -
(a)
Granting or refusing to grant any measure under
section 9;
(
b)
Setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral
award under section 34.
(2) An appeal shall also lie to a Court from an order
granting of the arbitral tribunal. Œ
(a)
accepting the plea referred in sub-section (2) or
sub-section (3) of section 16; or
(b)
granting or refusing to grant an interim measure
under Section 17.
(3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed
in appeal under this section, but nothing in this
section shall affect or take away any right to appeal
to the Supreme Court.ﬂ
13. At this stage, we are obliged to refer to the decision
in 
Paramjeet Singh Patheja v. ICDS Ltd.
3
 
In the said case
question arose whether an award passed by an arbitral tribunal
under the Act is a decree for the purposes of the provision of
the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909. The two Judge
Bench referred to various provisions of the Arbitration Act 1899,
The Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 and the Civil
Procedure Code, 1908, the concept of decree under the Code,
the provisions contained as regards award in Arbitration Act,
1940 and Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 and opined as follows:-
ﬁIn fact, Section 36 goes further than Section 15 of the
1899 Act and makes it clear beyond doubt that
enforceability is only to be under CPC. It rules out any
argument that enforceability as a decree can be sought
under any other law or that initiating insolvency proceeding
is a manner of enforcing a decree under CPC.ﬂ
The learned Judges further discussing the principles
proceeded to state as follows.

ﬁIssuance of a notice under the Insolvency Act is fraught
with serious consequences: it is intended to bring about
a drastic change in the status of the person against whom
a notice is issued viz. to declare him an insolvent with all
the attendant disabilities. Therefore, firstly, such a notice
was intended to be issued only after a regularly constituted
court, a component of the judicial organ established for the
dispensation of justice, has passed a decree or order for
the payment of money. Secondly, a notice under the
Insolvency Act is not a mode of enforcing a debt;
enforcement is done by taking steps for execution
available under CPC for realising monies.
42. The words ﬁas ifﬂ demonstrate that award and decree
or order are two different things. The legal fiction created
is for the limited purpose of enforcement as a decree. The
fiction is not intended to make it a decree for all purposes
under all statutes, whether State or Central.ﬂ
14. We have referred to aforesaid authority solely for the
purpose that whatever may be the status of the award under
the Act in respect of any other Statute, but when it is challenged
in an appeal under Section 37 of the Act the underlying
principle of the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable. We have
thought we should clarify the position as it may not be
understood that the decision in
 Pramjeet Singh Patheja 
(supra)
conveys that it is not a decree for all purposes and the
principles under the Code while an appeal is preferred is not
applicable.
15. In 
M/s. Pandey & Co. Builders Pvt. Ltd. v. State of
Bihar and Another,
4
 it has been held that a forum of an
appellate court must be determined with reference to the
definition thereof contained in the 1996 Act. The aforesaid
decision further reinforces the conclusion that Order XLI Rule
5 in principle is applicable to an appeal preferred before the
High Court, for there is no provision in the Act prohibiting the
appellate court not to take recourse to the underlying principles
of the Code of Civil Procedure as long as they are in
consonance with the spirit and principles engrafted under the
Act.
16. Presently to the anatomy of Order XLI. It deals with
appeals from original decrees. Order XLI Rule 5 provides for
stay by Appellate Court. To have a complete picture, it is
necessary to reproduce the Rule in entirety: -
ﬁ
5. Stay by Appellate Court
. Œ (1) An appeal shall not
operate as a stay of proceedings under a decree or order
appealed from except so far as the Appellate Court may
order, nor shall execution of a decree be stayed by reason
only of an appeal having been preferred from the decree;
but the Appellate Court may for sufficient cause order stay
of execution of such decree.
(2)
 Stay by Court which passed the decree
. Œ Where
an application is made for stay of execution of an
appealable decree before the expiration of the time
allowed for appealing therefrom, the Court which passed
the decree may on sufficient cause being shown order the
execution to be stayed.
(3) No order for stay of execution shall be made under sub-
rule (1) or sub-rule (2) unless the Court making it is satisfied
Œ
(a)
that substantial loss may result to the party applying
for stay of execution unless the order is made;
(b)
that the application has been made without
unreasonable delay; and
(c)
that security has been given by the applicant for the
due performance of such decree or order as may
ultimately be binding upon him.

ﬁOrder 41 Rule 1(3) CPC provides that in an appeal
against a decree for payment of amount the appellant shall,
within the time permitted by the appellate court, deposit
the amount disputed in the appeal or furnish such security
in respect thereof as the court may think fit. Under Order
41 Rule 5(5), a deposit or security, as abovesaid, is a
condition precedent for an order by the appellate court
staying the execution of the decree. 
A bare reading of the
two provisions referred to hereinabove, shows a discretion
having been conferred on the appellate court to direct
either deposit of the amount disputed in the appeal or to
permit such security in respect thereof being furnished as
the appellate court may think fit. Needless to say that the
discretion is to be exercised judicially and not arbitrarily
depending on the facts and circumstances of a given case
.
Ordinarily, execution of a money decree is not stayed
inasmuch as satisfaction of money decree does not
amount to irreparable injury and in the event of the appeal
being allowed, the remedy of restitution is always available
to the successful party. Still the power is there, of course
a discretionary power, and is meant to be exercised in
appropriate cases.ﬂ
[Emphasis supplied]
19. The submission advanced by the learned counsel for
the appellants that the provisions contained in Order XLI Rule
5 and XXVII Rule 8A of the Code should be read harmoniously
to avoid any conflict. Rule 8A of Order XXVII reads as follows:-
ﬁ
8A. No security to be required from Government or
a public officer in certain cases
. Œ No such security as
is mentioned in rules 5 and 6 of Order XLI shall be
required from the Government or, where the Government
has undertaken the defence of the suit, from any public
officer sued in respect of an act alleged to be done by him
in his official capacity.ﬂ
(4) Subject to the provisions of sub-rule (3), the Court may
make an 
ex parte
 order for stay of execution pending the
hearing of the application.
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing
sub-rules, where the appellant fails to make the deposit or
furnish the security specified in sub-rule (3) of rule 1, the
Court shall not make an order staying the execution of the
decree.ﬂ
17. At this stage, regard being had to the schematic
content of order XLI Rule 5, we think it appropriate to refer to
certain authorities how the language employed in the said Rule
has been appreciated and understood by this Court. In
Kayamuddin Shamsuddin Khan v. State Bank of India
5
 
while
dealing the command of the provision relating to deposit the
Court had to say:
ﬁ...that when non-compliance with the direction given
regarding deposit under sub-rule (3) of Rule 1 of Order XLI
would result in the Court refusing to stay the execution of
the decree. In other words, the application for stay of the
execution of the decree could be dismissed for such non-
compliance but the Court could not give a direction for the
dismissal of the appeal itself for such non-compliance.ﬂ
18. In 
Sihor Nagar Palika Bureau v. Bhabhlubhai Virabhai
& Co.,
6
 
this Court was dealing with the situation where the
appellant municipality constituted and governed by the provision
of Gujrat Municipalities Act, 1963 had assailed a money decree
in appeal and the High Court in appeal had directed stay of
the execution of operation of the money decree subject to the
condition that the appellant shall deposit a certain sum with
interest by a particular date. In that context the Court adverted
to Order XLI Rule 1(3) and 5 (5) and opined thus:-

necessary to appreciate the definitive character of the
Government in the context it has been used. In 
Utkal
Contractors & Joinery Pvt. Ltd. and Others v. State of Orissa
and Others,
7
 it has been laid down that while the words of an
enactment are important the context is not less important. It has
also been stated that no provision in the statute and no word
of the statute may be construed in isolation. The importance of
setting and the pattern are to be kept in mind. In 
Dy. Chief
Controller of Imports & Exports, New Delhi v. K.T. Kosalram
and Others
8
 this Court has observed as under:
ﬁWhat particular meaning should be attached to words and
phrases in a given instrument is usually to be gathered
from the context, the nature of the subject-matter, the
purpose or the intention of the author and the effect of
giving to them one or the other permissible meaning on
the object to be achieved. Words are after all used merely
as a vehicle to convey the idea of the speaker or the writer
and the words have naturally, therefore, to be so construed
as to fit in with the idea which emerges on a consideration
of the entire context. Each word is but a symbol which may
stand for one or a number of objects. The context, in which
a word conveying different shades of meanings is used,
is of importance in determining the precise sense which
fits in with the context as intended to be conveyed by the
author....ﬂ
23. As we perceive, the legislature has used the word
ﬁGovernmentﬂ in Order XXVII Rule 8A and defined the same in
Order XXVII Rule 8B. The intention is absolutely clear and
unambiguous. It means the ﬁGovernmentﬂ in exclusivity. The
submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that the
appellant being a Jal Sansthan it would come within the
extended wing of the Government does not commend
acceptation.
20. As far as the Government is concerned, it has been
defined in Order XXVII Rule 8B. It reads as follows: -
ﬁ
8B. Definitions of ﬁGovernmentﬂ and ﬁGovernment
pleaderﬂ
. Œ In this order unless otherwise expressly,
provided ﬁGovernment and ﬁGovernment pleaderﬂ mean
respectively Œ
(a)
In relation to any suit by or against the Central
Government or against a public officer in the service
of the Government, the Central Government and
such pleader as that Government may appoint

Order;

Government pleader as defined in clause (7) of
section 2, or such other pleader as the State
Government may appoint, whether generally or
specially, for the purpose of this order.ﬂ
21. The legislature has defined the term ﬁGovernmentﬂ not
to allow any room for interpretation and speculation. It means
either a Central Government or a State Government and in
certain cases public officer in the service of a State. Learned
counsel for the appellant has contended that the appellant
ﬁKanpur Jal Sansthanﬂ is an extended wing of the State and,
therefore, is a part of the Government. On a bare glance at the
aforesaid provisions it is perspicuous that it categorically lays
a postulate that as far as the Government or a public officer is
concerned in certain cases the stipulations incorporated in
Order XLI Rule 5 would not be applicable.
22. Having regard to the aforesaid provisions it is

Government, as understood in the context of Entry 5 of List II
of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, the concept of
State in International Law and thereafter to the conception of
the federal construction of the Constitution and the conception
of governance under the Constitution and, eventually, opined
that: -
ﬁFrom the legal point of view, government may be
described as the exercise of certain powers and the
performance of certain duties by public authorities or
officers, together with certain private persons or
corporations exercising public functions. The structure of
the machinery of Government and the regulation of the
powers and duties which belong to the different parts of
this structure are defined by the law which also prescribes
to some extent the mode in which these powers are to be
exercised or these duties are to be performed (see
Halsbury™s Laws of England, Fourth Edition, Vol. 8, para
804
). Government generally connotes three estates,
namely, the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary
while it is true that in a narrow sense it is used to connote
the Executive only. The meaning to be assigned to that
expression, therefore, depends on the context in which it
is used.ﬂ
Thereafter the Court proceeded to further rule thus: -
ﬁWe are of the view that the word ‚Government™ in Article
102(1)(a) and in Article 191(1)(a) of the Constitution and
the word ‚Government™ in the expression ﬁan officer of
Governmentﬂ in Section 21 of the Act should be interpreted
liberally so as to include within its scope the Legislature,
the Executive and the Judiciary
. The High Court erred in
equating the word ‚Government™ occurring in Section 21
of the Act to the Executive Government only and in further
holding that the officers of the State Legislature could not
be treated as officers of Government for purposes of that
section.ﬂ
24. We have reasons to so conclude. In 
State of Punjab
and others v. Raja Ram and Others,
9
 a two-Judge Bench, after
referring to a passage from 
Ramana Dayaram Shetty v.
International Airport Authority of India and Others
10
 
and stating
what makes a corporation an agency or instrumentality of the
Central Government, opined thus: -
ﬁEven the conclusion, however, that the Corporation is an
agency or instrumentality of the Central Government does
not lead to the further inference that the Corporation is a
Government department.ﬂ
25. In 
Pashupati Nath Sukul v. Nem Chandra Jain and
Others,
11
 a question arose whether the Secretary of a State
Legislative Assembly is qualified or not to be appointed as the
Returning Officer at an election held to fill a seat in the Rajya
Sabha. The High Court of Allahabad had returned a finding that
the Secretary of the Legislative Assembly was neither an officer
of the Government nor of a local authority and hence, could not
have been appointed as the Returning Officer under Section
21 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Dealing with
the said issue, the three-Judge Bench proceeded to analyse
whether the expression ﬁGovernmentﬂ used in Section 21 would
mean the ﬁExecutive Governmentﬂ in the narrow sense or a
liberal construction should be placed. The Court referred to
Section 3(23) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which defines
ﬁGovernmentﬂ to mean ﬁGovernmentﬂ or ﬁthe Governmentﬂ to
include both the Central Government and any State
Government. Thereafter, the Court referred to certain
constitutional provisions, namely, Articles 12, 102(1)(a),
191(1)(a), 98, 187, 146, 229, 148(5), 311 and 318 and the

6. In 
R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay,
13
 the Court was dealing
with as to what the expression ﬁGovernmentﬂ exactly connotes
in the context of Indian Penal Code. Answering the issue the
Constitution Bench stated thus: -
ﬁThere is a short and a long answer to the problem. Section
17 IPC provides that ﬁthe word ‚Government™ denotes the
Central Government or the Government of a Stateﬂ.
Section 7 IPC provides that ﬁevery expression which is
explained in any part of the Code, is used in every part of
the Code in conformity with the explanationﬂ. Let it be
noted that unlike the modern statute Section 7 does not
provide ﬁunless the context otherwise indicateﬂ a phrase
that prefaces the dictionary clauses of a modern statute.
Therefore, the expression ﬁGovernmentﬂ in Section
21(12)(
a
) must either mean the Central Government or the
Government of a State.ﬂ
After so stating the Larger Bench referred to many an
authority and proceeded to rule thus: -
ﬁ
56.
 There thus is a broad division of functions such as
executive, legislative and judicial in our Constitution. The
Legislature lays down the broad policy and has the power
of purse. The Executive executes the policy and spends
from the Consolidated Fund of the State what Legislature
has sanctioned. The Legislative Assembly enacted the Act
enabling to pay to its members salary and allowances. And
the members vote the grant and pay themselves. In this
background even if there is an officer to disburse this
payment or that a pay bill has to be drawn-up are not such
factors being decisive of the matter. That is merely a
mode of payment, but the MLAs by a vote retained the
fund earmarked for purposes of disbursal for pay and
allowances payable to them under the relevant statute.
Therefore, even though MLA receives pay and allowances,
he is not in the pay of the State Government because
Legislature of a State cannot be comprehended in the
expression ﬁstate Governmentﬂ.
57.
 This becomes further clear from the provision
contained in Article 12 of the Constitution which provides
that ﬁfor purposes of Part III, unless the context otherwise
requires, ﬁthe Stateﬂ includes the Government and
Parliament of India and the Government and the
Legislature of each of the States and all local or other
authorities within the territory of India or under the control
of the Government of Indiaﬂ. The expression ﬁGovernment
and Legislatureﬂ, two separate entities, are sought to be
included in the expression ﬁstateﬂ which would mean that
otherwise they are distinct and separate entities. 
This
conclusion is further reinforced by the fact that the
Executive sets up its own secretariat, while Article 187
provides for a secretarial staff of the Legislature under the
control of the Speaker, whose terms and conditions of the
service will be determined by the Legislature and not by
the Executive. When all these aspects are pieced together,
the expression ﬁGovernmentﬂ in Section 21(12)(
a
) clearly
denotes the Executive and not the Legislature
.ﬂ
[Underlining is ours]
27. We have referred to the aforesaid authorities to
highlight that in certain contexts the term ﬁGovernmentﬂ may be
required to be liberally construed and under certain
circumstances it has to be understood in a narrow spectrum.
The concept of ﬁStateﬂ as used under Article 12 is quite
different than what is meant by an ﬁExecutive Governmentﬂ. In
fact to determine whether a body is an instrumentality or
agency of the Government this Court has laid down general
principles but no exhaustive tests have been specified. As has
been held in 
Chander Mohan Khanna v. National Council of

 even in
general principles there is no cut and dried formula which would
provide correct division of bodies into those which are
instrumentalities or agencies of the Government and those
which are not. In that case the Court opined that where the
financial assistance from the State is so much as to meet
almost entire expenditure of the institution, or the share capital
of the corporation is completely held by the Government, it
would afford some indication of the bodies being impregnated
with governmental character. It may be a relevant factor if the
institution or the corporation enjoys monopoly status which is
State conferred or State protected. Existence of deep and
pervasive State control may afford an indication. It has been
laid down therein that if the functions of the institution are of
public importance and related to governmental functions, it
would also be a relevant factor and these are merely indicative
indicia and are by no means conclusive or clinching in any case.
It has been further opined therein, after referring to host of
decisions, that a wide enlargement of the meaning must be
tempered by a wise limitation, for the State control does not
render such bodies as ﬁStateﬂ under Article 12 of the
Constitution. The State control, however, vast and pervasive is
not determinative; the financial contribution by the State is also
not conclusive. If the Government operates behind a corporate
veil, carrying out governmental functions of vital public
importance, there may be little difficulty in identifying the body
as ﬁStateﬂ.
28. At this stage, we may usefully refer to a three-Judge
Bench decision in 
Ramana Dayaram Shetty 
(supra) wherein
Bhagwati, J. (as his Lordship then was) opined that where a
corporation is an instrumentality or agency of Government, it
would, in the exercise of its power or discretion, be subject to
the same constitutional or public law limitations as Government.
The rule inhibiting arbitrary action by Government must apply
equally where such corporation is dealing with the public,
whether by way of giving jobs or entering into contracts or
otherwise, and it cannot act arbitrarily and enter into relationship
with any person it likes at its sweet will, but its action must be
in conformity with some principle which meets the test of reason
and relevance. This rule also flows directly from the doctrine of
equality embodied in Article 14.
29. The reference to the aforesaid authorities by us is only
for the purpose that an authority or instrumentality of the State
or agency of the State has to act in a fair, non-arbitrary and
reasonable manner and, in fact, is controlled by Chapter III of
the Constitution but it does not assume the character of
ﬁGovernmentﬂ for all purposes. As we find from the language
employed in Order XXVII Rules 8A and 8B, it only means the
ﬁGovernmentﬂ. In fact, Rule 8B clearly states ﬁin relation to any
suit by or against the Central Government or against a public
officer in the service of the Governmentﬂ and similar language
is used for the State Government. Hence, the legislature has
deliberately used a restrictive definition and its scope cannot
be expanded to cover an agency or instrumentality of the State
by interpretative process.
30. Learned counsel for the appellants, as stated earlier,
has commended us to the decision in 
Kuruvilla 
(supra) of the
High Court of Kerala wherein the Division Bench placing
reliance on the decision in 
Collector, Cuttack v. Padma Charan
Mohanty
15
 has basically dealt with the applicability of Order
XXVII Rule 8A and grant of stay under Order XLI Rule 5 when
the State is the appellant. We do not intend to express any
opinion on the correctness of the said decisions as the
controversy does not arise in the present case because it is
neither the Central Government nor the State Government in that
sense in appeal before us. It is the ﬁJal Sansthanﬂ which claims
to be an extended wing or agency of the State has preferred
the appeal. We have clearly ruled that Order XXVII Rules 8A
and 8B are applicable only to the Government and not to

ENVIRONMENT (PROTECTION) ACT, 1986:
s. 3(3) Š National Regulator Œ Order of Supreme Court
dated 6.7.2011 directing for appointment of National
Regulator ŒHeld: In Lafarge Umiam Mining™s case, on an
interpretation of s. 3 (3), the Court took a view that it confers
a power coupled with duty to appoint an appropriate authority
in the form of a Regulator at the State and at the Central level
for appraising projects, enforcing environmental conditions for
approvals and to impose penalties on polluters and
accordingly directed the Central Government to appoint a
National Regulator under the said provision, as the Court did
not find the mechanism of making the EIA appraisals of
projects by MoEF to be satisfactory Š The mechanism under
EIA Notification dated 14.09.2006, issued by Government with
regard to processing, appraisals and approval of the projects
for environmental clearance is deficient in many respects and
what is required is a Regulator at the national level having
its offices in all the States which can carry out an independent,
objective and transparent appraisal and approval of the
projects for environmental clearances and which can also
monitor the implementation of the conditions laid down in the
Environmental Clearances Š The Regulator so appointed u/
s 3(3) can exercise only such powers and functions of Central
instrumentality or agency of the State. That is the specific and
definite language employed by the legislature and for that
purpose we have drawn a distinction between the concept of
ﬁStateﬂ under Article 12 and the ﬁGovernmentﬂ as used in Order
XXVII Rules 8A and 8B.
31. Coming to the legal validity of the impugned order we
find that the High Court has directed for deposit of the money
and withdrawal of the 50% of the same without furnishing
security and remaining half after furnishing security. The High
Court has not given any justifiable reason for permitting such
withdrawal. Without commenting on the merits of the grounds
sought to be urged before us (to which we have not referred
to in detail not being necessary) we only modify the order that
the appellant shall furnish the security for the entire amount to
the satisfaction of the concerned District Judge within a period
of six weeks. As the scope of appeal is very limited, we would
request the High Court to dispose of the appeal by the end of
June, 2014.
32. Resultantly, with the aforesaid modifications in the
order passed by High Court, the appeal stands disposed
without any order as to costs.

The following Order of the Court was delivered
O R D E R
1. In the case of 
Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited
v. 
Union of India & Ors
. [(2011) 7 SCC 338], this Court, while
refusing to interfere with the decisions of the Ministry of
Environment and Forests (MoEF) granting site clearance, EIA
clearance read with revised environmental clearance and
Stage I forest clearance to the mining project of Lafarge
Umiam Mining Private Limited, laid down some guidelines to
be followed in future cases in Part-II of its order dated
06.07.2011. These guidelines have been stated in Para 122
of the said order and sub-para (i.1.) of Para 122, this Court
called upon the Central Government to appoint a National
Regulator under Section 3(3) of the Environment (Protection)
Act, 1986 for appraising projects, enforcing environmental
conditions for approvals and to impose penalties on polluters.
Despite the order dated 06.07.2011 of this Court, the Central
Government did not appoint a National Regulator under
Section 3(3) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. On
09.09.2013, this Court therefore requested Mr. Mohan
Parasaran, learned Solicitor General, to obtain instructions and
apprise this Court as to when the direction of this Court will
be complied with.
2. When the matter was taken up on 18.11.2013 again,
Mr. Mohan Parasaran, learned Solicitor General, relying on the
affidavit filed on behalf of the MoEF, submitted that in the case
of Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited, this Court was really
concerned with the National Forest Policy, 1988. He submitted
that so far as the National Forest Policy, 1988 is concerned,
the same relates to forests and under Section 2 of the Forest
(Conservation) Act, 1980 the duty of a Regulator has been cast

Environmental Clearances is already in place, it is not
necessary for the Central Government to appoint a National
Regulator under sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986. Mr. Parasaran finally submitted that Part
II of the order dated 06.07.2011 of this Court in the case of
Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited is titled ﬁGuidelines to
be followed in future casesﬂ and hence the observations of this
Court in Part II were in the nature of suggestions of this Court
and the Central Government is considering these suggestions
and has not taken a decision to appoint a National Regulator
under sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986.
4. Mr. Harish N. Salve, learned Amicus Curiae, on the other
hand, submitted that it will be clear, on a reading of Para 122
of the order dated 06.07.2011 of this Court in the case of
Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited, that this Court held that
Section 3 of the Envrionment (Proection) Act, 1986 confers a
power coupled with duty and it is incumbent on the Central
Government, to appoint a Regulator. He submitted that the order
of this Court was therefore in the nature of a mandamus to the
Central Government to appoint a National Regulator and the
plea taken on behalf of the Union of India that the order to
appoint a National Regulator was in the nature of a suggestion
is misconceived. He argued that the order in the case of
Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited 
was passed on
06.07.2011, and no review petition was filed in response of the
order dated 06.07.2011, and after two years of the passing of
the order, the Union of India cannot refuse to comply with the
order of this Court. Mr. Salve referred to notifications issued
by the Central Government under Section 3(3) of the
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 constituting authorities,
such as the Notification dated 17.09.1998 constituting the
Arunachal Pradesh Forest Protection Authority.
upon the Central Government. He submitted that the
responsibility to appraise proposals seeking prior approval of
the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest
(Conservation) Act, 1980 lies with the Forest Advisory
Committee constituted by the Central Government under
Section 3 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. He argued
that these statutory duties of the Central Government under
Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 cannot be
delegated to any other authority.
3. Mr. Parasaran next submitted that sub-section (1) of
Section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 similarly
confers powers on the Central Government to take all such
measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the purpose
of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and
preventing, controlling and abating environmental pollution and
the Central Government in exercise of its powers under sub-
section (1) and clause (v)(b) of sub-section (2) of Section 3
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 had issued the EIA
Notification dated 14.09.2006. He explained that the EIA
Notification dated 14.09.2006 provides that the prior
environmental clearance from the Central Government, or as
the case may be, from the State Level Environment Impact
Assessment Authority, shall be taken for construction of new
projects or activities or the expansion or modernization of
existing projects or activities mentioned in the Schedule to this
Notification. He submitted that the Central Government through
MoEF is, thus, undertaking appraisals of projects in
accordance with the Notification dated 14.09.2006. He
submitted that compliance of the conditions stipulated in the
environmental clearance granted to the projects are being
monitored and enforced six Regional Offices of the MoEF are
functioning at Bangalore, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh,
Lucknow and Shillong. He submitted that as an appropriate
mechanism for appraising projects as well as monitoring and
enforcing compliance of environmental conditions that govern

5. We have considered the submissions of Mr. Parasaran
and Mr. Salve and the main question that we have to decide is
whether the order of this Court in 
Lafarge Umiam Mining
Private Limited
 for appointing a National Regulator under
Section 3(3) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 was
merely a suggestion or a mandamus to the Central Government.
Sub-paragraphs (i.1), (i.2.), (i.3.), (i.4.) and (i.5.) of paragraph
122 of the order of this Court in the case of 
Lafarge Umiam
Mining Private Limited 
are extracted hereinbelow
:
ﬁ
(i.1.)
 The time has come for this Court to declare and we
hereby declare that the National Forest Policy, 1988 which
lays down far-reaching principles must necessarily govern
the grant of permissions under Section 2 of the Forest
(Conservation) Act, 1980 as the same provides the road
map to ecological protection and improvement under the
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The principles/
guidelines mentioned in the National Forest Policy, 1988
should be read as part of the provisions of the Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986 read together with the Forest
(Conservation) Act, 1980. This direction is required to be
given because there is no machinery even today
established for implementation of the said National Forest
Policy, 1988 read with the Forest (Conservation) Act,
1980. 
Section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
confers a power coupled with duty and, thus, it is incumbent
on the Central Government, as hereinafter indicated, to
appoint an appropriate authority, preferably in the form of
regulator, at the State and at the Central level for ensuring
implementation of the National Forest Policy, 1988
.
(
i.2
.) The difference between a regulator and a court
must be kept in mind. The court/tribunal is basically an
authority which reacts to a given situation brought to its
notice whereas a regulator is a proactive body with the
power conferred upon it to frame statutory rules and
regulations. The regulatory mechanism warrants open
discussion, public participation and circulation of the draft
paper inviting suggestions.
(
i.3
.) The basic objectives of the National Forest
Policy, 1988 include positive and proactive steps to be
taken. These include maintenance of environmental
stability through preservation, restoration of ecological
balance that has been adversely disturbed by serious
depletion of forests, conservation of natural heritage of the
country by preserving the remaining natural forests with the
vast variety of flora and fauna, checking soil erosion and
denudation in the catchment areas, checking the extension
of sand dunes, increasing the forest/tree cover in the
country and encouraging efficient utilisation of forest
produce and maximising substitution of wood.
(

.) Thus, we are of the view that 
under Section 3(3)
of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Central
Government should appoint a National Regulator for
appraising projects, enforcing environmental conditions for
approvals and to impose penalties on polluters
.
(
i.5
.) 
There is one more reason for having a
regulatory mechanism in place
. Identification of an area as
forest area is solely based on the declaration to be filed
by the user agency (project proponent). The project
proponent under the existing dispensation is required to
undertake EIA by an expert body/institution. In many cases,
the court is not made aware of the terms of reference. In
several cases, the court is not made aware of the study
area undertaken by the expert body. Consequently, MoEF/
State Government acts on the report (Rapid EIA)
undertaken by the institutions who though accredited
submit answers according to the terms of reference
propounded by the project proponent. We do not wish to

cast any doubt on the credibility of these institutions.
However, at times the court is faced with conflicting
reports. Similarly, the Government is also faced with a fait
accompli kind of situation which in the ultimate analysis
leads to grant of ex post facto clearance. 
To obviate these
difficulties, we are of the view that a regulatory mechanism
should be put in place and till the time such mechanism is
put in place
, MoEF should prepare a panel of accredited
institutions from which alone the project proponent should
obtain the Rapid EIA and that too on the terms of reference
to be formulated by MoEF.ﬂ
It will be clear from the underlined portions of the order of
this Court in 
Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited 
extracted
above
 
that this Court on an interpretation of Section 3 (3) of
the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 has taken a view that
it confers a power coupled with duty to appoint an appropriate
authority in the form of a Regulator at the State and at the
Central level for appraising projects, enforcing environmental
conditions for approvals and to impose penalties on polluters
and has accordingly directed the Central Government to
appoint a National Regulator under the said provision of the Act.
Mr. Parasaran is, therefore, not right in arguing that in the case
of 
Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited, 
this Court has
merely suggested that a National Regulator should be
appointed and has not issued any mandamus to appoint a
National Regulator.
6. We further find on reading of sub-paragraphs (i.2), (i.3)
and (i.5) of Paragraph 122 of the order in the case of 
Lafarge
Umiam Mining Private Limited 
extracted above that this Court
has not found the mechanism of making the EIA appraisals of
projects by the MoEF to be satisfactory. As a matter of fact,
we also find that the Department of Management Studies,
Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, has prepared report on
‚
Scope, Structure and Processes of National Environment
Assessment and Monitoring Authority
 (NEAMA)™ for the
Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India, and
the Executive Summary of the Report points out the problems
with regard to the implementation of EIA 2006 Notification.
Paragraph 4 from Section I of the Executive Summary under
the heading ‚
Major Findings & Recommendations
™, is
extracted hereinbelow:
ﬁ4. We analysed the implementation of EIA 2006
notification and the proposed CZM notification 2010 in
terms of policy, structure and process level issues. Almost
all the problems in implementing these notifications relate
to structure and processes. Key issues are mentioned
below
a. The presence of MoEF in both the appraisal and
approval processes leads to a perception of conflict of
interest. The Member Secretary (who, according to the
2006 notification, was supposed to be the Secretary) is
involved in the processing, appraisal and approval of the
EIA applications.
b. Lack of permanence in the Expert Appraisal
Committees leads to lack of continuity and institutional
memory leading to poor knowledge management.
c. Current EIA and CRZ clearances rely predominantly on
the data provided by the project proponent and the
absence of authenticated and reliable data and lack of
mechanisms to validate the data provided by the project
proponent might lead to subjectivity, inconsistency and
inferior quality of EIA reports.
d. Though the EIA notification requires several documents
like ToRs (for every project), minutes of public hearing
meetings (for each project), EIA report (with clearance
conditions) and self-monitoring reports to be put in public

domain (predominantly on the website), this has not been
done for lack of institutional mechanisms. This leads to a
perception of lack of transparency in the processes.
e. Several studies have pointed toward the poor monitoring
of the clearance conditions. Huge gaps in monitoring and
enforcement of clearance conditions actually defeats the
very purpose of grant of conditional environmental
clearance.ﬂ (See moef.nic.in/downloads/public-information/
exec-summ-NEMA.pdf)
7. Hence, the present mechanism under the EIA
Notification dated 14.09.2006, issued by the Government with
regard to processing, appraisals and approval of the projects
for environmental clearance is deficient in many respects and
what is required is a Regulator at the national level having its
offices in all the States which can carry out an independent,
objective and transparent appraisal and approval of the projects
for environmental clearances and which can also monitor the
implementation of the conditions laid down in the
Environmental Clearances. The Regulator so appointed under
Section 3(3) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 can
exercise only such powers and functions of the Central
Government under the Environment (Protection) Act as are
entrusted to it and obviously cannot exercise the powers of the
Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest
(Conservation) Act, 1980, but while exercising such powers
under the Environment Protection Act will ensure that the
National Forest Policy, 1988 is duly implemented as held in the
order dated 06.07.2011 of this Court in the case of 
Lafarge
Umiam Mining Private Limited. 
Hence, we also do not find any
force in the submission of Mr. Parasaran that as under Section
2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 the Central
Government alone is the Regulator, no one else can be
appointed as a Regulator as directed in the case of 
Lafarge
Umiam Mining Private Limited.
8. We, therefore, direct the Union of India to appoint a
Regulator with offices in as many States as possible under sub-
section (3) of Section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act,
1986 as directed in the order in the case of 
Lafarge Umiam
Mining Private Limited 
and file an affidavit along with the
notification appointing the Regulator in compliance of this
direction
 
by 31st March, 2014.
9. The I.As. will stand disposed of accordingly.

that death was caused because of shock but he has not stated
that it was due to the injuries caused by appellant or that
deceased profusely bled which could have caused shock Š
It is not shown that the injuries found on the person of the

of nature could cause shock Š It, therefore, creates a doubt
as to whether deceased suffered shock on account of injuries
sustained by him Œ However, it has been proved that
appellant shot at deceased with an intention to kill him or at

Š Allegations proved constitute an offence u/s 307 Š
Conviction of appellant is altered from s. 302 to s. 307 and
he is sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for ten years.
The appellant (in Crl. A. No. 985 of 2007) and his
father (appellant in Crl. A. No. 21 of 2014) were prosecuted
for commission of offences punishable u/ss 302, 114 and
427, IPC and s. 3 read with ss. 25 and 27 of the Arms Act.
The prosecution case was that there was a long standing
enmity between the family of the informant and the
accused in respect of certain land over which appellant™s
father was claiming tenancy rights. On the date of
occurrence while the informant (PW-1) and others were
going to the coffee estate and their companion ‚C™ was
ahead of them, the appellant fired at ‚C™. After the first shot,
his father instigated him to fire again. The appellant fired
for the second time at ‚C™ and thereafter they left the
place. P.Ws. 1 to 3, took the victim to the village, but he
died on the way. The trial court acquitted both the
accused of all the charges. However, the High Court,
reversed their acquittal and held the appellant guilty of
offences punishable u/ss 302 and 427, IPC and s. 27 of
the Arms Act and sentenced him to imprisonment for life
u/s 302 IPC and imprisonment for one year u/s 27 of the
Arm Act. Both of them were also convicted and sentenced
to undergo simple imprisonment for one week for offence
u/s 427, IPC.
Disposing of the appeals, the Court
HELD: 1.1.For holding an accused guilty of murder,
the prosecution has first to prove that it is a culpable
homicide, as defined u/s 299, IPC and an accused will
come under the mischief of this section only when the

1.2. In the instant case, the doctor, who conducted
the post-mortem examination, was categorical in his
evidence that no internal injuries were found and the gun
was fired from a distant range. As regards the cause of
death, he has opined that it was because of shock but
he has nowhere stated that it was due to the injuries
caused by the appellant or that the deceased profusely

Basant R., Shekhar G. Devasa, Karthik Ashok (for Adarsh
Upadhyay), Vijay Kumar for the Appellant.
Anitha Shenoy, V.N. Raghupathy for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
CHANDRAMAULI KR. PRASAD, J.
 1. 
Appellant,
besides his father Bhadregowda, was put on trial for offence
punishable under Section 302, 114 and 427 of the Indian Penal
Code and Section 3 read with Section 25 and 27 of the Arms
Act. Additional Sessions Judge, Hasan, vide judgment and
order dated 24th of February, 2000 passed in Sessions Case
No. 24 of 1992, acquitted both the accused of all the charges.
Aggrieved by the same, the State of Karnataka preferred an
appeal. The High Court, vide judgment and order dated 9th of
February, 2007 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 991 of 2000,
reversed their acquittal and held the appellant M.B. Suresh
guilty of offence punishable under Section 302 and 427 of the
Indian Penal Code and Section 25 and 27 of the Arms Act.
However, his father Bhadregowda was found guilty of offence
punishable under Section 427 of the Indian Penal Code alone.
Appellant M.B. Suresh was sentenced to undergo life
imprisonment for offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal
Code and fine of Rs. 5,000/-, and in default to undergo simple
imprisonment for six months. He was also sentenced to
undergo one year™s imprisonment and fine of Rs. 2,000/- for
offence under Section 27 of the Arms Act. Both of them were
sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for one week for
offence under Section 427 of the Indian Penal Code and fine
of Rs. 5,000/- each. Sentences were directed to run
concurrently. Aggrieved by the same, M.B. Suresh has preferred
taken to the hospital for treatment, he died on the way.
Any mishandling of the deceased by the person carrying
him to the hospital so as to cause shock cannot be ruled
out. It, therefore, creates a doubt as to whether the
deceased suffered shock on account of the injuries
sustained by him. It is not shown that the injuries found
on the person of the deceased were of such nature,
which in the ordinary course of nature could cause
shock. It cannot be assumed that those injuries can
cause shock in the absence of any evidence in this
regard. There is no evidence to show that it was the injury
inflicted by the appellant which was the cause of death.
Thus, it cannot be held that it is the act of the appellant
which caused the death. Therefore, conviction of the
appellant u/s 302, IPC cannot be sustained. [para 6] [106-
A-B, C-G]
2.1. However, it has been proved that the appellant
shot at the deceased with an intention to kill him or at
least he had the knowledge that the act would cause the
death. Accordingly, the allegations proved constitute an
offence u/s 307, IPC. Therefore, the conviction of the
appellant is altered from s. 302 to s. 307, IPC and he is
sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for ten years.
However, his conviction under other penal provisions
and the conviction of the other appellant is maintained.

the present appeal whereas his father Bhadregowda, aggrieved
by his conviction and sentence, has preferred Special Leave
Petition No. 5363 of 2007.
2. Leave granted in Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No.
5363 of 2007.
3. According to the prosecution there was a long standing
enmity between the family of the informant and the accused in
respect of land of Survey No. 29/2 and 22 of Marur Village over
which the accused Bhadregowda was claiming tenancy rights.
According to the prosecution, on 19th of November, 1991 the
deceased Chandrashekar, along with his elder brother
Raghunath, cousin Krishnegowda, a friend Prakash and one
Suresh came to the residence of Halegowda in the Village
Marur in a tractor-trailer for unloading the gunny bags. After
unloading the gunny bags, they sent the tractor-trailer along with
the labourers to the coffee plantation of Ramegowda to pluck
coffee seeds. However, the aforesaid persons stayed back at
Halegowda™s house to have a cup of coffee and later, at about
10.30 A.M., while they were going to coffee estate by the side
of the wetland of Ramegowda, Chandrashekar was ahead of
them. At that time, Chandrashekar was shot at by the appellant
M.B. Suresh, who was standing near the gate made of bamboo.
After the first shot, his father Bhadregowda instigated him to
fire again and at that the appellant M.B. Suresh fired for the
second time at the deceased and thereafter they left the place.
P.Ws. 1 to 3, namely Krishnegowda, Raghunath and Prakash
respectively, rushed to the place where Chandrashekar had
fallen on the ground and in order to save him, they carried him
to the village, but unfortunately he died because of the gun shot
injury on their way to the village. On the basis of the report given
by  Krishnegowda (PW-1), a case was registered at the Bellur
Police Station. Post-mortem on the dead body was conducted
by Dr. Gunashekar V.C.(PW-10), who found nine injuries on the
person of the deceased caused by the appellant.
ﬁ1.
Three circular pellet wounds present over the left
part of the fore head, each measuring 0.5 cm. in
diameter bony deep over an area of 4 cm. x 4 cm.

that it was because of shock. The trial court, on appreciation
of evidence, came to the conclusion that the prosecution had
not been able to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt
and, accordingly, acquitted them of both the charges. However,
the judgment of acquittal has been reversed by the High Court
in an appeal preferred by the State.
5. We have heard Mr. Basant R., learned Senior Advocate,
on behalf of the appellant whereas the respondent, State of
Karnataka is represented by Ms. Anitha Shenoy. Mr. Basant
submits that even if the entire case of the prosecution is
accepted, the same does not constitute an offence under
Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. He submits that
according to the prosecution, the deceased died of shock but
there is nothing on record to show that the shock was on
account of the injury inflicted by the appellant M.B. Suresh. He
further submits that the prosecution has not brought any
evidence to show that the deceased suffered any grievous hurt
and in that view of the matter, the appellant at most can be held
guilty for an offence under Section 324 of the Indian Penal
Code. He points out that the appellant M.B. Suresh has already
remained in jail for more than 10 years. Ms. Shenoy, however,
contends that the very fact that the deceased died within a few
hours of the incident, it has to be assumed that the cause of
death, i.e. shock had occurred on account of the gun shot injury
caused by the appellant M.B. Suresh.
6. We have bestowed our consideration to the rival
submissions and we partly find substance in the submission of
Mr. Basant R. Dr. Gunashekar V.C.(PW-10) had conducted the
post-mortem examination on the dead body of the deceased
Chandrashekar and, as stated earlier, had found nine injuries
on his person out of which six were skin deep of the size of
0.5 or less than 0.5 cm., three circular wounds each measuring
0.5 cm. bone deep found over an area of 4 cm. x 4 cm. over
the left side of the forehead as also a lacerated wound of the
same size over the left side of the front of the neck and another
muscle deep wound of the same size on the right arm. The
doctor conducting the post-mortem examination was
categorical in his evidence that no internal injuries were found
and the gun was fired from a distant range. As regards the
cause of death, the doctor has opined that it was because of
shock but he has nowhere stated that it was due to the injuries
caused by the appellant. For holding an accused guilty of
murder, the prosecution has first to prove that it is a culpable
homicide. Culpable homicide is defined under Section 299 of
the Indian Penal Code and an accused will come under the
mischief of this section only when the act done by him has
caused death. True it is that the deceased died of shock but
there is no evidence to show that the shock had occurred on
account of the injuries caused by the appellant. We cannot
ignore that the case of the prosecution itself is that after the
deceased sustained injuries while he was being taken to the
hospital for treatment, he died on the way. Any mishandling of
the deceased by the person carrying him to the hospital so as
to cause shock cannot be ruled out. The doctor had not stated
that the deceased profusely bled which could have caused
shock. In the absence of any such evidence, we are in doubt
as to whether the deceased suffered shock on account of the
injuries sustained by him. It is not shown that the injuries found
on the person of the deceased were of such nature, which in
the ordinary course of nature could cause shock. We cannot
assume that those injuries can cause shock in the absence of
any evidence in this regard. The doctor has not even remotely
suggested that the shock was caused due to the injuries
sustained by the deceased. In the face of what we have
observed above, we are not in a position of hold that it is the
act of the appellant, which caused death. Hence, we are of the
opinion that the conviction of the appellant under Section 302
of the Indian Penal Code cannot be sustained.
7. Next question which falls for our consideration is as to
the offence for which the appellant M.B. Suresh would be liable.
What has been proved against this appellant is that he shot at

the deceased, but there is no evidence to show that it was the
injury inflicted by the appellant which was the cause of death.
However, from the facts proved, there is no doubt that he shot
at the deceased with an intention to kill him or at least he had
the knowledge that the act would cause the death. Accordingly,
we are of the opinion that the allegations proved constitute an
offence under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. The view
which we have taken finds support from the judgment of this
Court in the case of
 Bhupendra Singh v. State of U.P., (1991)
2 SCC 750
, in which it has been observed as follows:
ﬁ9.
–––The evidence only established that the first
appellant shot at the deceased but it is not known where
the bullet hit and whether that injury caused by the said
bullet shot caused the death. Even in the case of shooting
by a rifle unless the evidence shows the particular injury
caused by the same and that injury is sufficient to cause
death, the offence under Section 302 IPC could not be said
to have been made out. In the circumstances, therefore,
we are unable to agree with the High Court that the first
appellant is guilty of offence under Section 302 IPC of
causing the death of Gajendra Singh. However, we are of
the view that while the first appellant shot at the deceased
there could be no doubt that either he had the intention to
kill him or at least he had the knowledge that the act could
cause the death.
10.
 All the witnesses also say that the shot by A 1 brought
down the deceased to the ground. There could, therefore,
be no doubt that the shot had caused some hurt or injury
though we could not predicate what was the nature of the
injury and whether that injury could have caused the death.
In the circumstances we consider that the offence would
come under the second limb or second part of Section
307, IPC. Though imprisonment for life also could be
awarded as sentence for such an offence on the facts and
circumstances we impose a sentence of 10 years rigorous
imprisonment. Accordingly we alter the conviction under
Section 302, IPC as one under Section 307 IPC and
sentence him to a term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment.ﬂ
8. Accordingly, we alter the conviction of the appellant M.B.
Suresh from Section 302 to Section 307 of the Indian Penal
Code and sentence him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for
ten years.
9. 
Mr. Basant R. has not assailed the conviction of the
appellant M.B. Suresh other than Section 302 of the Indian
Penal Code. As regards the conviction of the other accused
Bhadregowda under Section 427, it is on correct appreciation
of evidence, which does not call for interference in the present
appeal.
10. In the result, Criminal Appeal No. 985 of 2007 is partly
allowed, the conviction of the appellant M.B. Suresh under
Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code is set aside and is altered
to Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code and he is sentenced
to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years. However, his
conviction under other penal provisions is maintained.
Sentences awarded to him shall run concurrently. As the
appellant has already remained in custody for more than 10
years, we direct that he be set at liberty forthwith unless
required in any other case.
11. 
The appeal (arising out of Special Leave Petition
(Criminal) No. 5363 of 2007) preferred by the appellant
Bhadregowda is, however, dismissed.

INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES:
Non-obstante clause in a statute Œ General provisions
and special provision Œ Interpretation of.
An FIR for offences u/ss 33(a) and 58 of the Delhi
Excise Act, 2009 was registered, as 47 cartons of
unauthorized liquor were found inside a vehicle. The
respondent™s application for release of the vehicle was
rejected by the Magistrate. However, the High Court
allowed his petition under s.482 of the Code and directed
the vehicle to be released on furnishing security.
The State filed the instant appeal contending that in
view of the embargo put by s.61 of the Delhi Excise Act,
the High Court had no jurisdiction to pass an order for
release of the vehicle.
Allowing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 1.1. Section 33(a) of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009
makes it evident that transportation of any intoxicant in
contravention of the provisions of the Act or of any rule
or order made or notification issued or any licence, permit
or pass, is punishable and any vehicle used for carrying
the same, is liable for confiscation u/s 58(d) of the Act.
Section 59 of the Act deals with the power of
confiscation of Deputy Commissioner in certain cases.
Under the scheme of the Act any vehicle used for carrying
the intoxicant is liable to be confiscated and on seizure
of such vehicle, the same is required to be produced
before the Deputy Commissioner, who in turn has been
conferred with the power of its confiscation. [para 8] [115-
E-F, G-H; 116-A]
1.2. Section 61 of the Act puts an embargo on
jurisdiction of courts laying down that notwithstanding
anything contrary contained in any other law for the time
being in force, no court shall have jurisdiction to make
any order with regard to the property used in committing
any offence and seized under the Act. [para 9-10] [116-

1.3. In the instant case, the High Court, while
releasing the vehicle on security has exercised its power
u/s 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The
general provision of s.451 of the Code with regard to the
custody and disposal of the property or for that matter
by destruction, confiscation or delivery to any person
entitled to possession thereof u/s 452 of the Code or that
of s.457 authorising a Magistrate to make an order for
disposal of property, if seized by an officer and not
produced before a criminal court during an inquiry or
trial, however, has to yield where a statute makes a
special provision with regard to its confiscation and
disposal. [para 11] [116-E, G-H; 117-A-B]
1.4. From the scheme of the Act it is evident that the
vehicle seized has to be produced before the Deputy
Commissioner, who in turn has been conferred with the
power of its confiscation or release to its rightful owner.
The requirement of production of seized property before
the Deputy Commissioner u/s 59(1) of the Act is,
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law,
and, so also is the power of confiscation. In the instant
case, the Legislature has used a non-obstante clause
not only in s.59 but also in s.61 of the Act. A non-obstante
clause is a legislative device to give effect to the enacting
part of the section in case of conflict over the provisions
mentioned in the non-obstante clause. Therefore, ss.451,
452 and 457 of the Code must yield to the provisions of
the Act; and the Magistrate or for that matter the High
Court, while dealing with the case of seizure of vehicle
under the Act, has no power to pass an order dealing
with the interim custody of the vehicle on security or its
release. [para 11] [117-B-F]

 1. The State of
Delhi, aggrieved by the order dated 28th of November, 2011
passed by the Delhi High Court in Criminal M.C. No. 2540 of
2011, whereby it had directed for release of the vehicle bearing
Registration No. HR-56-7290 to the registered owner on
security, has preferred this special leave petition.
2. Leave granted.
3. Shorn of unnecessary details, facts giving rise to the
present appeal are that while constables Raghmender Singh
and Sunil were on night patrolling duty at Kirari Nithari turn on
17th of April, 2011, they saw a vehicle coming from the side of
the Nithari Village. Constable Raghmender Singh signalled the
driver to stop the vehicle, but he did not accede to his command

furnishing security to the satisfaction of the Metropolitan
Magistrate. While doing so, the High Court has observed as
follows:
ﬁ–––The vehicle in question was seized by the Police
and not confiscated and if that was so, Section 58, Delhi
Excise Act would not apply with regard to the vehicle in
question and the procedure that was to be followed
regarding the vehicle was to be found in Chapter VI of Delhi
Excise Act and also Section 451, Cr.P.C–––ﬂ
5. 
Mr. Mohan Jain, Additional Solicitor General appears
on behalf of the appellant whereas the respondent is
represented by Mr. Harish Pandey. Mr. Jain submits that in view
of the embargo put by Section 61 of the Delhi Excise Act, the
High Court had no jurisdiction to pass an order for release of
the vehicle on security. Mr. Pandey, however, submits that the
High Court has the power under Section 451 of the Code to
direct for release of the vehicle on security and the same is legal
and valid.
6. Rival submissions necessitate examination of the
scheme of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009 (hereinafter referred to
as ‚the Act™). Section 33 of the Act provides for penalty for
unlawful import, export, transport, manufacture, possession, sale
etc. of intoxicant and Section 33(a), which is relevant for the
purpose reads as follows:
ﬁ33
. 
Penalty for unlawful import, export, transport,
manufacture, possession, sale, etc.
- (1) Whoever, in
contravention of provision of this Act or of any rule or order
made or notification issued or of any licence, permit or
pass, granted under this Act-
(a) manufactures, imports, exports, transports or removes
any intoxicant;

and turned the vehicle into the Prem Nagar Extension Lane.
Both the constables chased the vehicle on their motorcycle and
the driver of the vehicle, apprehending that he would be caught,
left the vehicle and ran away from the place, taking advantage
of the darkness. The vehicle abandoned by the driver was
ﬁCruiser Forceﬂ and had registration No. HR-56-7290. After
opening of the windows of the vehicle, 27 Cartons, each
containing 12 bottles of 750 ml. Mashaledar country-made
liquor and 20 Cartons, each containing 48 quarters of Besto
Whisky were found inside the vehicle. All the 47 Cartons were
embossed with ‚Sale in Haryana only™. Constable Raghmender
Singh gave a report to the police and on that basis FIR No.
112 of 2011 dated 17.04.2011 was registered at Aman Vihar
Police Station under Section 33(a) and Section 58 of the Delhi
Excise Act, 2009. During the course of investigation, Narender,
respondent herein, claiming to be the owner of the vehicle, filed
an application for its release on security, before the
Metropolitan Magistrate, Rohini, who, by his order dated 24th
of May, 2011 rejected the same, inter alia, holding that he has
no power to release the vehicle seized in connection with the
offence under the Delhi Excise Act. The respondent again filed
an application for the same relief i.e. for release of the vehicle
on security before the Metropolitan Magistrate but the said
application also met with the same fate. By order-dated 14th
of July, 2011, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate declined to
pass the order for release, inter alia, observing that any order
directing for release of the vehicle on security would amount
to review of the order dated 24th of May, 2011, which power
the court did not possess.
4. A
ggrieved by the same, the respondent filed an
application before the High Court under Section 482 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as ‚the
Code™), assailing the order dated 24th May, 2011 passed by
the learned Metropolitan Magistrate. The High Court, by its
impugned order dated 28th of November, 2011 directed the
vehicle to be released in favour of the registered owner on

shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which
shall not be less than six months but which may extend to
three years and with fine which shall not be less than fifty
thousand rupees but which may extend to one lakh rupees.ﬂ
7. Section 58 of the Act provides for confiscation of certain
things and Section 58(d) thereof, with which we are concerned
in the present appeal, reads as follows:
ﬁ58. Certain things liable to confiscation
.- Whenever
an offence has been committed, which is punishable under
this Act, following things shall be liable to confiscation,
namely-
xxx                  xxx
               xxx
(d) any animal, vehicle, vessel, or other conveyance
used for carrying the same.ﬂ
8. From a plain reading of Section 33(a) of the Act, it is
evident that transportation of any intoxicant in contravention of
the provisions of the Act or of any rule or order made or
notification issued or any licence, permit or pass, is punishable
and any vehicle used for carrying the same, is liable for
confiscation under Section 58(d) of the Act. Section 59 of the
Act deals with the power of confiscation of Deputy
Commissioner in certain cases. Section 59(1) thereof provides
that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law where
anything liable for confiscation under Section 58 is seized or
detained, the officer seizing and detaining such thing shall
produce the same before the Deputy Commissioner. On
production of the seized property, the Deputy Commissioner,
if satisfied that the offence under the Act has been committed,
may order confiscation of such property. Therefore, under the
scheme of the Act any vehicle used for carrying the intoxicant
is liable to be confiscated and on seizure of the vehicle
transporting the intoxicant, the same is required to be produced
before the Deputy Commissioner, who in turn has been
conferred with the power of its confiscation.
9. 
Section 61 of the Act puts an embargo on jurisdiction
of courts, the same reads as follows:
ﬁ61. Bar of jurisdiction in confiscation.
- Whenever any
intoxicant, material, still, utensil, implement, apparatus or
any receptacle, package, vessel, animal, cart, or other
conveyance used in committing any offence, is seized or
detained under this Act, no court shall, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in any other law for the
time being in force, have jurisdiction to make any order with
regard to such property.ﬂ
10. According to this section, notwithstanding anything
contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force,
no court shall have jurisdiction to make any order with regard
to the property used in committing any offence and seized under
the Act.
11. 
It is relevant here to state that in the present case, the
High Court, while releasing the vehicle on security has
exercised its power under Section 451 of the Code. True it is
that where any property is produced by an officer before a
criminal court during an inquiry or trial under this section, the
court may make any direction as it thinks fit for the proper
custody of such property pending the conclusion of the inquiry
or trial, as the case may be. At the conclusion of the inquiry or
trial, the court may also, under Section 452 of the Code, make
an order for the disposal of the property produced before it and
make such other direction as it may think necessary. Further,
where the property is not produced before a criminal court in
an inquiry or trial, the Magistrate is empowered under Section
457 of the Code to make such order as it thinks fit. In our
opinion, the general provision of Section 451 of the Code with
regard to the custody and disposal of the property or for that
matter by destruction, confiscation or delivery to any person
entitled to possession thereof under Section 452 of the Code

or that of Section 457 authorising a Magistrate to make an
order for disposal of property, if seized by an officer and not
produced before a criminal court during an inquiry or trial,
however, has to yield where a statute makes a special provision
with regard to its confiscation and disposal. We have referred
to the scheme of the Act and from that it is evident that the
vehicle seized has to be produced before the Deputy
Commissioner, who in turn has been conferred with the power
of its confiscation or release to its rightful owner. The
requirement of production of seized property before the Deputy
Commissioner under Section 59(1) of the Act is,
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, and, so
also is the power of confiscation. Not only this, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in any other law for the time
being in force, no court, in terms of Section 61 of the Act, has
jurisdiction to make any order with regard to the property used
in commission of any offence under the Act. In the present case,
the Legislature has used a non-obstante clause not only in
Section 59 but also in Section 61 of the Act. As is well settled,
a non-obstante clause is a legislative device to give effect to
the enacting part of the section in case of conflict over the
provisions mentioned in the non-obstante clause. Hence,
Section 451, 452 and 457 of the Code must yield to the
provisions of the Act and there is no escape from the conclusion
that the Magistrate or for that matter the High Court, while
dealing with the case of seizure of vehicle under the Act, has
any power to pass an order dealing with the interim custody of
the vehicle on security or its release thereof. The view which
we have taken finds support from a judgment of this Court in
the case of 
State of Karnataka v. K.A. Kunchindammed,
(2002) 9 SCC 90, which while dealing with somewhat similar
provisions under the Karnataka Forest Act held as follows:-
ﬁ
23
–––.The position is made clear by the non obstante
clause in the relevant provisions giving overriding effect to
the provisions in the Act over other statutes and laws. The
necessary corollary of such provisions is that in a case
where the Authorized Officer is empowered to confiscate
the seized forest produce on being satisfied that an
offence under the Act has been committed thereof the
general power vested in the Magistrate for dealing with
interim custody/release of the seized materials under
CrPC has to give way. The Magistrate while dealing with
a case of any seizure of forest produce under the Act
should examine whether the power to confiscate the
seized forest produce is vested in the Authorized Officer
under the Act and if he finds that such power is vested in
the Authorized Officer then he has no power to pass an
order dealing with interim custody/release of the seized
material. This, in our view, will help in proper
implementation of provisions of the special Act and will
help in advancing the purpose and object of the statute. If
in such cases power to grant interim custody/release of the
seized forest produce is vested in the Magistrate then it
will be defeating the very scheme of the Act. Such a
consequence is to be avoided.
24.
 From the statutory provisions and the analysis made
in the foregoing paragraphs the position that emerges is
that the learned Magistrate and the learned Sessions
Judge were right in holding that on facts and in the
circumstances of the case, it is the Authorized Officer who
is vested with the power to pass order of interim custody
of the vehicle and not the Magistrate. The High Court was
in error in taking a view to the contrary and in setting aside
the orders passed by the Magistrate and the Sessions
Judge on that basis.ﬂ
12. 
From a conspectus of what we have observed above,
the impugned order of the High Court is found to be vulnerable
and, therefore, the same cannot be allowed to stand.
13. To put the record straight it is relevant here to state that
the counsel for the respondent had not, and in our opinion rightly,
challenged the vires of the provisions of the Act in view of the

In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the
impugned judgment and order of the High Court and hold that
the High Court exceeded in its jurisdiction in directing for release
of the vehicle on security.

Medical Jurisprudence:
DNA test Œ Nature and evidentiary value of Œ Explained.
The instant appeal was filed by the husband
challenging the order of maintenance u/s 125 CrPC as
regards the daughter and denying the paternity of the
child. His case was that his wife was residing separately
and during the relevant period he had no access to her.
He applied for referring the child for DNA test and its
report excluded him from being the biological father of
the child. Respondent no. 1-wife requested for re-test and
its report from a different institute also was to the same
effect. It was contended for the respondents that the
appellant having failed to establish that he had no access
to his wife at any time when she could have begotten
respondent no. 2, the direction for DNA test ought not to
have been given and, as such, the result of such a test
was fit to be ignored.
Allowing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 1.1. This Court twice gave directions for DNA
test. The respondents did not oppose the prayer of DNA
test when such a prayer was being considered. It was
only after the reports of the DNA test had been received,
which was adverse to the respondents, that they
challenged it on the ground that such a test ought not to
have been directed. This Court, at this stage, cannot go
into the validity of the orders passed by a coordinate
Bench. It has attained finality. [para 10] [129-C-E]

Bhabani Prasad Jena
v. Orissa State Commission for Women,
 
2010 (9) SCR 457
= (2010) 8 SCC 633 Œ held inapplicable.
1.2. It has been recognized by this Court in the case
of 
Kamti Devi
 that the result of a genuine DNA test is
scientifically accurate. It is nobody™s case that the result
of the DNA test is not genuine and, therefore, it has to be
assumed that the result of the DNA test is accurate. The
DNA test reports show that the appellant is not the
biological father of the girl-child. [para 12] [131-C]
Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram

SCC 311Œ referred to.
1.3. From a plain reading of s.112 of the Evidence Act,
1872, it is evident that a child born during the continuance
of a valid marriage shall be a conclusive proof that the
child is a legitimate child of the man to whom the lady
giving birth is married. The provision makes the
legitimacy of the child to be a conclusive proof, if the
conditions are satisfied. It can be denied only if it is
shown that the parties to the marriage had no access to
each other at any time when the child could have been
begotten. [para 14] [131-G-H; 132-A]
1.4. The DNA test is an accurate test and on that
basis it is clear that the appellant is not the biological
father of the girl-child. However, at the same time, the
condition precedent for invocation of s.112 of the
Evidence Act has been established and no finding with
regard to the plea of the husband that he had no access
to his wife at the time when the child could have been
begotten, has been recorded. [para 15] [132-D]
1.5. Section 112 of the Evidence Act was enacted at
a time when the modern scientific advancement and DNA
test were not even in contemplation of the Legislature.
The result of DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate.
Although s.112 raises a presumption of conclusive proof
on satisfaction of the conditions enumerated therein but
the same is rebuttable. Interest of justice is best served

by ascertaining the truth and the court should be
furnished with the best available science and may not be
left to bank upon presumptions, unless science has no
answer to the facts in issue. When there is a conflict
between a conclusive proof envisaged under law and a
proof based on scientific advancement accepted by the
world community to be correct, the latter must prevail
over the former. [para 16] [132-G-H; 133-A-B]
1.6. Legal fiction assumes existence of a fact which
may not really exist. However presumption of a fact
depends on satisfaction of certain circumstances. Those
circumstances logically would lead to the fact sought to
be presumed. Section 112 of the Evidence Act does not
create a legal fiction but provides for presumption. [para
17] [133-C-D]
1.7. The husband™s plea that he had no access to the
wife when the child was begotten stands proved by the
DNA test report and in the face of it, he cannot be
compelled to bear the fatherhood of the child, when the
scientific reports prove to the contrary. The impugned
judgment is set aside so far as it directs payment of
maintenance to respondent no. 2. However, the
payments already made shall not be recovered from the
respondents. [para 18 and 20] [133-F; 134-C]

Manish Pitale, Wasi Haider (for Chander Shekhar Ashri)
for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
CHANDRAMAULI KR. PRASAD, J.
 1. Petitioner
happens to be the husband of respondent no. 1, Lata Nandlal
Badwaik and alleged to be the father of girl child Netra alias
Neha Nandlal Badwaik, respondent no. 2, herein. The marriage
between them was solemnized on 30th of June, 1990 at
Chandrapur. Wife filed an application for maintenance under
Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but the same
was dismissed by the learned Magistrate by order dated 10th
December, 1993. Thereafter, the wife resorted to a fresh
proceeding under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the ‚Code™) claiming
maintenance for herself and her daughter, inter alia, alleging
that she started living with her husband from 20th of June, 1996
and stayed with him for about two years and during that period
got pregnant. She was sent for delivery at her parents™ place
where she gave birth to a girl child, the respondent no. 2 herein.
Petitioner-husband resisted the claim and alleged that the
assertion of the wife that she stayed with him since 20th of
June, 1996 is false. He denied that respondent no. 2 is his
daughter. After 1991, according to the husband, he had no
physical relationship with his wife. The learned Magistrate
accepted the plea of the wife and granted maintenance at the
rate of Rs.900/- per month to the wife and at the rate of Rs.500/
- per month to the daughter. The challenge to the said order in
revision has failed so also a petition under Section 482 of the
Code, challenging those orders.

It is against these orders, the petitioner has preferred this
special leave petition.
2. Leave granted.
3. Taking note of the challenge to the paternity of the child,
this Court by order dated 10th of January, 2011 passed the
following order:
ﬁ––––However, the petitioner-husband had challenged
the paternity of the child and had claimed that no
maintenance ought to have been awarded to the child. The
petitioner had also applied for referring the child for DNA
test, which was refused. It is against the said order of
refusal that the present Special Leave was filed and the
same prayer for conducting the DNA test was made before
us. On 8th November, 2010 we had accordingly, directed
the petitioner-husband to deposit all dues, both arrear and
current, in respect of the maintenance awarded to the wife
and child to enable us to consider the prayer for holding
of such DNA test. Such deposit having been made on 3rd
January, 2011, we had agreed to allow the petitioner™s
prayer for conducting DNA test for ascertaining the
paternity of the child.
We have since been informed by counsel for the
parties that a Forensic Science Laboratory in Nagpur
conducts the very same test, as has been asked for, by
the Petitioner. Accordingly, we direct the petitioner-Nandlal
Wasudeo Badwaik and the respondent No. 1-Ms. Lata
Nandlal Badwaik to make a joint application to the
Forensic Science Laboratory, Nagpur, situated at Jail
Road, Dhantoli, for conducting such test. The petitioner, as
well as the respondent No. 1, shall present themselves at
the Laboratory with respondent No. 2 for the said purpose
on the date to be fixed by the laboratory, and, thereafter,
the laboratory is directed to send the result of such test to
this Court within four weeks thereafter. The expenses for
the test to be conducted shall be borne by the petitioner-
husband.ﬂ
4. 
In the light of the aforesaid order, the Regional Forensic
Science Laboratory, Nagpur has submitted the result of DNA
testing and opined that appellant ﬁNandlal Vasudev Badwaik
is excluded to be the biological father of Netra alias Neha
Nandlal Badwaikﬂ, respondent no. 2 herein.
5. Respondents, not being satisfied with the aforesaid
report, made a request for re-test. The said prayer of the
respondents was accepted and this Court by order dated 22nd
of July, 2011 gave the following direction:
ﬁDespite the fact that the report of the DNA Test conducted
at the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, State of
Maharashtra, Nagpur-12, indicates that the petitioner is not
the biological father of the respondent No. 2, on the prayer
made on behalf of the respondents for a re-test, we are of
the view that such a prayer may be allowed having regard
to the serious consequences of the Report which has been
filed.
Accordingly, we direct that a further DNA Test be
conducted at the Central Forensic Laboratory, Ministry of
Home Affairs, Government of India at Hyderabad and for
the said purpose the parties are directed to appear before
the Laboratory on 24th August, 2011 at 11.00 a.m.ﬂ
6. 
As directed, the Central Forensic Science Laboratory,
Hyderabad submitted its report and on that basis opined that
the appellant, ﬁNandlal Wasudeo Badwaik can be excluded from
being the biological father of Miss Neha Nandlal Badwaikﬂ,
respondent no. 2 herein.
7. At the outset, Mr. Manish Pitale appearing for the
respondents submits that the appellant having failed to establish
that he had no access to his wife at any time when she could
have begotten respondent no. 2, the direction for DNA test ought

not to have been given. In view of the aforesaid he submits that
the result of such a test is fit to be ignored. In support of the
submission he has placed reliance on a judgment of this Court
in 
Goutam Kundu v. State of W.B.,
 (1993) 3 SCC 418, relevant
portions whereof read as under:
ﬁ24.
 This section requires the party disputing the paternity
to prove non-access in order to dispel the presumption.
ﬁAccessﬂ and ﬁnon-accessﬂ mean the existence or non-
existence of opportunities for sexual intercourse; it does
not mean actual ﬁcohabitationﬂ.
26.
 From the above discussion it emergesŠ
(
1) That courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter
of course;
(2) wherever applications are made for such prayers in
order to have roving inquiry, the prayer for blood test cannot
be entertained.
(3) there must be a strong prima facie case in that the
husband must establish non-access in order to dispel the
presumption arising under Section 112 of the Evidence
Act.
(4) the court must carefully examine as to what would be
the consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it will
have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and the
mother as an unchaste woman.
(5) no one can be compelled to give sample of blood for
analysis.
27.
 Examined in the light of the above, we find no difficulty
in upholding the impugned order of the High Court,
confirming the order of the Additional Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Alipore in rejecting the application for blood
test–––––.ﬂ
8. Yet another decision on which reliance has been placed
is the decision of this Court in the case of 
Banarsi Dass v.
Teeku Dutta,
 (2005) 4 SCC 449, paragraph 13, which is
relevant for the purpose is quoted below:
ﬁ13.
 We may remember that Section 112 of the Evidence
Act was enacted at a time when the modern scientific
advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well
as ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not even in
contemplation of the legislature. The result of a genuine
DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. But even that
is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of
Section 112 of the Evidence Act e.g. if a husband and wife
were living together during the time of conception but the
DNA test revealed that the child was not born to the
husband, the conclusiveness in law would remain
irrebuttable. This may look hard from the point of view of
the husband who would be compelled to bear the
fatherhood of a child of which he may be innocent. But even
in such a case the law leans in favour of the innocent child
from being bastardised if his mother and her spouse were
living together during the time of conception. Hence the
question regarding the degree of proof of non-access for
rebutting the conclusiveness must be answered in the light
of what is meant by access or non-access as delineated
above. (See 
Kamti Devi
 v. 
Poshi Ram, 2001 (5) SCC
311
.)ﬂ
9. Reliance has also been placed on a decision of this
Court in the case of 
Bhabani Prasad Jena v. Orissa State
Commission for Women
, (2010) 8 SCC 633, in which it has
been held as follows:
ﬁ22.
 In our view, when there is apparent conflict between
the right to privacy of a person not to submit himself forcibly
to medical examination and duty of the court to reach the
truth, the court must exercise its discretion only after
balancing the interests of the parties and on due

consideration whether for a just decision in the matter,
DNA test is eminently needed. DNA test in a matter relating
to paternity of a child should not be directed by the court
as a matter of course or in a routine manner, whenever
such a request is made. The court has to consider diverse
aspects including presumption under Section 112 of the
Evidence Act; pros and cons of such order and the test of
ﬁeminent needﬂ whether it is not possible for the court to
reach the truth without use of such test.ﬂ
10. Miss Anagha S. Desai appearing on behalf of the
appellant submits that this Court twice ordered for DNA test
and, hence, the question as to whether this was a fit case in
which DNA profiling should or should not have been ordered
is academic. We find substance in the submission of Ms.
Desai. Fact of the matter is that this Court not only once, but
twice gave directions for DNA test. The respondents, in fact,
had not opposed the prayer of DNA test when such a prayer
was being considered. It is only after the reports of the DNA
test had been received, which was adverse to the respondents,
that they are challenging it on the ground that such a test ought
not to have been directed. We cannot go into the validity of the
orders passed by a coordinate Bench of this Court at this stage.
It has attained finality. Hence, we do not find any merit in the
submission of the learned counsel for the respondents. As
regards the decision of this Court in the cases of 
Goutam
Kundu (supra), Banarsi Dass (supra) 
and 
Bhabani Prasad
Jena (supra)
, the same have no bearing in the facts and
circumstances of the case. In all these cases, the court was
considering as to whether facts of those cases justify passing
of an order for DNA test. When the order for DNA test has
already been passed, at this stage, we are not concerned with
this issue and we have to proceed on an assumption that a
valid direction for DNA test was given.
11. Ms. Desai submits that in view of the opinions, based
on DNA profiling that appellant is not the biological father, he
cannot be fastened with the liability to pay maintenance to the
girl-child born to the wife. Mr. Pitale, however, submits that the
marriage between the parties has not been dissolved, and the
birth of the child having taken place during the subsistence of
a valid marriage and the husband having access to the wife,
conclusively prove that the girl-child is the legitimate daughter
of the appellant. According to him, the DNA test cannot rebut
the conclusive presumption envisaged under Section 112 of the
Evidence Act. According to him, respondent no. 2, therefore,
has to be held to be the appellant™s legitimate daughter. In
support of the submission, reliance has been placed on a
decision of this Court in the case of 
Kamti Devi v. Poshi Ram,
(2001) 5 SCC 311, and reference has been made to paragraph
10 of the judgment, which reads as follows:
ﬁ10. –––
The result of a genuine DNA test is said to be
scientifically accurate. But even that is not enough to
escape from the conclusiveness of Section 112 of the Act
e.g. if a husband and wife were living together during the
time of conception but the DNA test revealed that the child
was not born to the husband, the conclusiveness in law
would remain irrebuttable. This may look hard from the
point of view of the husband who would be compelled to
bear the fatherhood of a child of which he may be innocent.
But even in such a case the law leans in favour of the
innocent child from being bastardised if his mother and her
spouse were living together during the time of
conception–––.ﬂ
12. Before we proceed to consider the rival submissions,
we deem it necessary to understand what exactly DNA test is
and ultimately its accuracy. All living beings are composed of
cells which are the smallest and basic unit of life. An average
human body has trillion of cells of different sizes. DNA
(Deoxyribonucleic Acid), which is found in the chromosomes
of the cells of living beings, is the blueprint of an individual.
Human cells contain 46 chromosomes and those 46

chromosomes contain a total of six billion base pair in 46
duplex threads of DNA. DNA consists of four nitrogenous bases
Œ adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine and phosphoric acid
arranged in a regular structure. When two unrelated people
possessing the same DNA pattern have been compared, the
chances of complete similarity are 1 in 30 billion to 300 billion.
Given that the Earth™s population is about 5 billion, this test shall
have accurate result. It has been recognized by this Court in
the case of Kamti Devi (supra) that the result of a genuine DNA
test is scientifically accurate. It is nobody™s case that the result
of the DNA test is not genuine and, therefore, we have to
proceed on an assumption that the result of the DNA test is
accurate. The DNA test reports show that the appellant is not
the biological father of the girl-child.
13.  
Now we have to consider as to whether the DNA test
would be sufficient to hold that the appellant is not the biological
father of respondent no. 2, in the face of what has been
provided under Section 112 of the Evidence Act, which reads
as follows:
ﬁ
112. Birth during marriage, conclusive proof of
legitimacy.
- The fact that any person was born during the
continuance of a valid marriage between his mother and
any man, or within two hundred and eighty days after its
dissolution, the mother remaining unmarried, shall be
conclusive proof that he is the legitimate son of that man,
unless it can be shown that the parties to the marriage had
no access to each other at any time when he could have
been begotten.ﬂ
14. 
From a plain reading of the aforesaid, it is evident that
a child born during the continuance of a valid marriage shall
be a conclusive proof that the child is a legitimate child of the
man to whom the lady giving birth is married. The provision
makes the legitimacy of the child to be a conclusive proof, if
the conditions aforesaid are satisfied. It can be denied only if
it is shown that the parties to the marriage have no access to
each other at any time when the child could have been begotten.
Here, in the present case, the wife had pleaded that the
husband had access to her and, in fact, the child was born in
the said wedlock, but the husband had specifically pleaded that
after his wife left the matrimonial home, she did not return and
thereafter, he had no access to her. The wife has admitted that
she had left the matrimonial home but again joined her husband.
Unfortunately, none of the courts below have given any finding
with regard to this plea of the husband that he had or had not
any access to his wife at the time when the child could have
been begotten.
15. As stated earlier, the DNA test is an accurate test and
on that basis it is clear that the appellant is not the biological
father of the girl-child. However, at the same time, the condition
precedent for invocation of Section 112 of the Evidence Act
has been established and no finding with regard to the plea of
the husband that he had no access to his wife at the time when
the child could have been begotten has been recorded.
Admittedly, the child has been born during the continuance of
a valid marriage. Therefore, the provisions of Section 112 of
the Evidence Act conclusively prove that respondent No. 2 is
the daughter of the appellant. At the same time, the DNA test
reports, based on scientific analysis, in no uncertain terms
suggest that the appellant is not the biological father. In such
circumstance, which would give way to the other is a complex
question posed before us.
16. We may remember that Section 112 of the Evidence
Act was enacted at a time when the modern scientific
advancement and DNA test were not even in contemplation of
the Legislature. The result of DNA test is said to be scientifically
accurate. Although Section 112 raises a presumption of
conclusive proof on satisfaction of the conditions enumerated
therein but the same is rebuttable. The presumption may afford
legitimate means of arriving at an affirmative legal conclusion.
While the truth or fact is known, in our opinion, there is no need

or room for any presumption. Where there is evidence to the
contrary, the presumption is rebuttable and must yield to proof.
Interest of justice is best served by ascertaining the truth and
the court should be furnished with the best available science
and may not be left to bank upon presumptions, unless science
has no answer to the facts in issue. In our opinion, when there
is a conflict between a conclusive proof envisaged under law
and a proof based on scientific advancement accepted by the
world community to be correct, the latter must prevail over the
former.
17. We must understand the distinction between a legal
fiction and the presumption of a fact. Legal fiction assumes
existence of a fact which may not really exist. However
presumption of a fact depends on satisfaction of certain
circumstances. Those circumstances logically would lead to the
fact sought to be presumed. Section 112 of the Evidence Act
does not create a legal fiction but provides for presumption.
18. 
The husband™s plea that he had no access to the wife
when the child was begotten stands proved by the DNA test
report and in the face of it, we cannot compel the appellant to
bear the fatherhood of a child, when the scientific reports prove
to the contrary. We are conscious that an innocent child may
not be bastardized as the marriage between her mother and
father was subsisting at the time of her birth, but in view of the
DNA test reports and what we have observed above, we cannot
forestall the consequence. It is denying the truth. ﬁTruth must
triumphﬂ is the hallmark of justice.
19. As regards the authority of this Court in the case of
Kamti Devi
 (Supra), this Court on appreciation of evidence
came to the conclusion that the husband had no opportunity
whatsoever to have liaison with the wife. There was no DNA
test held in the case. In the said background i.e. non-access
of the husband with the wife, this Court held that the result of
DNA test ﬁis not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of
Section 112 of the Actﬂ. The judgment has to be understood in
the factual scenario of the said case. The said judgment has
not held that DNA test is to be ignored. In fact, this Court has
taken note of the fact that DNA test is scientifically accurate.
We hasten to add that in none of the cases referred to above,
this Court was confronted with a situation in which DNA test
report, in fact, was available and was in conflict with the
presumption of conclusive proof of legitimacy of the child under
Section 112 of the Evidence Act. In view of what we have
observed above, these judgments in no way advance the case
of the respondents.
20. In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the
impugned judgment so far as it directs payment of maintenance
to respondent no. 2. However, we direct that the payments
already made shall not be recovered from the respondents.

IPC and s. 13(2) read with 13 (1)(e) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 passed u/s 239 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973. In respect of accused-
respondent no. 1 in Crl. A. Nos. 22-23 of 2014, the High
Court in revision petition set aside the order of the Special

of accused-respondent no. 1 in Crl. A. Nos. 26-38 of 2014,
the revision petition against the order of the Special
Judge discharging the accused was dismissed by the
High Court. The allegations against respondents no. 1 in
both sets of appeals were that while they were Members
of the State Legislative Assemblies and Ministers in the
State Government, they acquired and possessed in their
own names and in the names of other accused, namely,
their relatives, pecuniary resources and properties
disproportionate to their known sources of income.

the offence without committal of the accused and the
Judge trying the accused is required to follow the
procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (the Code) for the trial of warrant cases by the
Magistrate. The Special Judge holding the trial is deemed
to be a Court of Session. [para 15] [148-C]
1.2. It is trite that at the stage of consideration of an
application for discharge, the court has to proceed with
an assumption that the materials brought on record by
the prosecution are true and evaluate the said materials
and documents with a view to find out whether the facts
emerging therefrom taken at their face value disclose the
existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged
offence. At this stage, probative value of the materials has
to be gone into and the court is not expected to go deep
into the matter and hold that the materials would not
warrant a conviction. What needs to be considered is
whether there is a ground for presuming that the offence
has been committed, and not whether a ground for
convicting the accused has been made out. If the court
thinks that the accused might have committed the offence
on the basis of the materials on record on its probative
value, it can frame the charge; though for conviction, the
court has to come to the conclusion that the accused
has committed the offence. The law does not permit a
mini trial at this stage. [para 19] [153-B-F]

1.3. Sections 227 and 239 provide for discharge
before the recording of evidence on the basis of the
police report, the documents sent along with it and
examination of the accused after giving an opportunity
to the parties to be heard. However, the stage of
discharge u/s 245, on the other hand, is reached only after
the evidence referred in s. 244 has been taken. Under s.
227 of the Code, the trial court is required to discharge
the accused if it ﬁconsiders that there is not sufficient
ground for proceeding against the accusedﬂ. However,
discharge u/s 239 can be ordered when ﬁthe Magistrate
considers the charge against the accused to be
groundlessﬂ. The power to discharge is exercisable u/s
245(1) when, ﬁthe Magistrate considers, for reasons to be
recorded that no case against the accused has been
made out which, if not repudiated, would warrant his
convictionﬂ. Thus, there is difference in the language
employed in these provisions. But, notwithstanding these
differences, and whichever provision may be applicable,
the court is required at this stage to see that there is a
prima facie case for proceeding against the accused.

made by the prosecution that the Ministers had acquired

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.22-23 OF 2014 (@SPECIAL
LEAVE PETITION(CRL.)Nos.3810-3811 of 2012)
1. The State of Tamil Nadu aggrieved by the order dated
10th of December, 2010 passed by the Madras High Court in
Criminal R.C.No.528 of 2009 and Criminal M.P.(MD) No.1 of
2009, setting aside the order dated 25th of September, 2009
passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate-cum-Special
Judge, Nagercoil (hereinafter referred to as ‚the Special
Judge™), whereby he refused to discharge the respondents, has
preferred these special leave petitions.
2. Leave granted.
3. Short facts giving rise to the present appeals are that
Respondent No. 1, N. Suresh Rajan, during the period from
13.05.1996 to 14.05.2001, was a Member of the Tamil Nadu
Legislative Assembly as also a State Minister of Tourism.
Respondent No. 2, K. Neelkanda Pillai is his father and
Respondent No. 3, R.Rajam, his mother. On the basis of an
information that N. Suresh Rajan, during his tenure as the
Minister of Tourism, had acquired and was in possession of

pecuniary resources and properties in his name and in the
names of his father and mother, disproportionate to his known
sources of income, Crime No. 7 of 2002 was registered at
Kanyakumari Vigilance and Anti Corruption Department on
14th of March, 2002 against the Minister N. Suresh Rajan, his
father, mother, elder sister and his bother-in-law. During the
course of the investigation, the investigating officer collected
and gathered informations with regard to the property and
pecuniary resources in possession of N. Suresh Rajan during
his tenure as the Minister, in his name and in the name of others.
On computation of the income of the Minister from his known
sources and also expenditure incurred by him, it was found that
the properties owned and possessed by him are
disproportionate to his known sources of income to the tune of
Rs. 23,77,950.94. The investigating officer not only examined
the accused Minister but also his father and mother as also his
sister and the brother-in-law. Ultimately, the investigating
agency came to the conclusion that during the check period,
Respondent No.1, N. Suresh Rajan has acquired and was in
possession of pecuniary resources and properties in his name
and in the names of his father, K. Neelakanda Pillai
(Respondent No. 2) and mother R. Rajam (Respondent No. 3)
and his wife D.S. Bharathi for total value of Rs. 17,58,412.47.
The investigating officer also came to the conclusion that
Minister™s father and mother never had any independent source
of income commensurate with the property and pecuniary
resources found acquired in their names. Accordingly, the
investigating officer submitted the charge-sheet dated 4th of
July, 2003 against Respondent No.1, the Minister and his father
(Respondent No.2) and mother (Respondent No.3) respectively,
alleging commission of an offence under Section 109 of the
Indian Penal Code and Section 13(2) read with Section
13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Respondents filed
application dated 5th of December, 2003 under Section 239
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred
to as ‚the Code™), seeking their discharge. The Special Judge,
by its order dated 25th of September, 2009 rejected their
prayer. While doing so, the Special Judge observed as follows:
ﬁ
At this stage it will be premature to say that there are no
sufficient materials on the side of the state to frame any
charge against them and the same would not be according
to law in the opinion of this court and at the same time this
court has come to know that there are basic materials for
the purpose of framing charges against the 3 petitioners,
the petition filed by the petitioners is dismissed and orders
passed to that effect.ﬂ
4. Aggrieved by the same, respondents filed criminal
revision before the High Court. The High Court by the impugned
judgment had set aside the order of the Special Judge and
discharged the respondents on its finding that in the absence
of any material to show that money passed from respondent
No. 1 to his mother and father, latter cannot be said to be holding
the property and resources in their names on behalf of their son.
The High Court while passing the impugned order heavily relied
on its earlier judgment in the case of 
State by Deputy
Superintendent of Police, Vigilance and Anti Corruption
Cuddalore Detachment v. K. Ponumudi & Ors.
 (2007-1MLJ-
CRL.-100), the validity whereof is also under consideration in
the connected appeals. The High Court while allowing the
criminal revision observed as follows:
ﬁ
12
.In the instant case, the properties standing in the name
of the petitioners 2 and 3 namely, A2 and A3 could not be
held to be the properties or resources belonging to the 1st
accused in the absence of any investigation into the
individual income resources of A2 and A3. Moreover, it is
not disputed that A2 was a retired Head Master receiving
pension and A3 is running a Financial Institution and an
Income Tax assessee. In the absence of any material to
show that A1™s money flow into the hands of A2 and A3,
they cannot be said to be holding the properties and
resources in their name on behalf of the first accused.
There is also no material to show that A2 and A3 instigated

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 26-38 OF 2014
(@
SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION(CRL.)Nos. 134-146 of
2013)
5. These special leave petitions are barred by limitation.
There is delay of 1954 days in filing the petitions and 217 days
in refiling the same. Applications have been filed for condoning
the delay in filing and refiling the special leave petitions.
6. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioner submits that the delay in filing the special leave
petitions has occurred as the Public Prosecutor earlier gave
an opinion that it is not a fit case in which special leave petitions
deserve to be filed. The Government accepted the opinion and
decided not to file the special leave petitions. It is pointed out
that the very Government in which one of the accused was a
Minister had taken the aforesaid decision not to file special
leave petitions. However, after the change of the Government,
opinion was sought from the Advocate General, who opined
that it is fit case in which the order impugned deserves to be
challenged. Accordingly, it is submitted that the cause shown
is sufficient to condone the delay.
7. Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for the respondents, however, submits that mere change of
Government would not be sufficient to condone the inordinate
delay. He submits that with the change of the Government,
many issues which have attained finality would be reopened
after long delay, which should not be allowed. According to him,
condonation of huge delay on the ground that the successor
Government, which belongs to a different political party, had
taken the decision to file the special leave petitions would be
setting a very dangerous precedent and it would lead to
miscarriage of justice. He emphasizes that there is a life span
for every legal remedy and condonation of delay is an
exception. Reliance has been placed on a decision of this Court
in the case of 
Postmaster General v. Living Media India Ltd.,
(2012) 3 SCC 563, and our attention has been drawn to
Paragraph 29 of the judgment, which reads as follows:
ﬁ29.
 In our view, it is the right time to inform all the
government bodies, their agencies and instrumentalities
that unless they have reasonable and acceptable
explanation for the delay and there was bona fide effort,
there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the
file was kept pending for several months/years due to
considerable degree of procedural red tape in the
process. The government departments are under a special
obligation to ensure that they perform their duties with
diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an
exception and should not be used as an anticipated benefit
for the government departments. The law shelters everyone
under the same light and should not be swirled for the
benefit of a few.ﬂ
8. Mr. Sorabjee further submits that the Limitation Act does
not provide for different period of limitation for the Government
in resorting to the remedy provided under the law and the case
in hand being not a case of fraud or collusion by its officers or
agents, the huge delay is not fit to be condoned. Reliance has
also been placed on a decision of this Court in the case of
Pundlik Jalam Patil v. Executive Engineer, Jalgaon Medium
Project, 
(2008) 17 SCC 448 and reference has been made to
Paragraph 31 of the judgment, which reads as follows:
ﬁ31.
 It is true that when the State and its instrumentalities
are the applicants seeking condonation of delay they may
be entitled to certain amount of latitude but the law of
limitation is same for citizen and for governmental
authorities. The Limitation Act does not provide for a
different period to the Government in filing appeals or

applications as such. It would be a different matter where
the Government makes out a case where public interest
was shown to have suffered owing to acts of fraud or
collusion on the part of its officers or agents and where the
officers were clearly at cross purposes with it. In a given
case if any such facts are pleaded or proved they cannot
be excluded from consideration and those factors may go
into the judicial verdict. In the present case, no such facts
are pleaded and proved though a feeble attempt by the
learned counsel for the respondent was made to suggest
collusion and fraud but without any basis. We cannot
entertain the submission made across the Bar without
there being any proper foundation in the pleadings.ﬂ
9. The contentions put forth by Mr. Sorabjee are weighty,
deserving thoughtful consideration and at one point of time we
were inclined to reject the applications filed for condonation of
delay and dismiss the special leave petitions. However, on a
second thought we find that the validity of the order impugned
in these special leave petitions has to be gone into in criminal
appeals arising out of Special Leave Petitions (Criminal) Nos.
3810-3811 of 2012 and in the face of it, it shall be unwise to
dismiss these special leave petitions on the ground of
limitation. It is worth mentioning here that the order impugned
in the criminal appeals arising out of Special Leave Petition
(Criminal) Nos. 3810-3811 of 2012, 
State of Tamil Nadu by
Ins. of Police, Vigilance and Anti Corruption v. N. Suresh
Rajan & Ors.,
 has been mainly rendered, relying on the
decision in State by Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vigilance
and Anti Corruption Cuddalore Detachment vs. K. Ponmudi and
Ors.(2007-1MLJ-CRL.-100), which is impugned in the present
special leave petitions. In fact, by order dated 3rd of January,
2013, these petitions were directed to be heard along with the
aforesaid special leave petitions. In such circumstances, we
condone the delay in filing and refiling the special leave
petitions.
10. 
In these petitions the State of Tamil Nadu impugns the
order dated 11th of August, 2006 passed by the Madras High
Court whereby the revision petitions filed against the order of
discharge dated 21st of July, 2004 passed by the Special
Judge/Chief Judicial Magistrate, Villupuram (hereinafter
referred to as ‚the Special Judge™), in the Special Case No. 7
of 2003, have been dismissed.
11. 
Leave granted.
12. Shorn of unnecessary details, facts giving rise to the
present appeals are that K. Ponumudi, respondent No. 1
herein, happened to be a Member of the State Legislative
Assembly and a State Minister in the Tamil Nadu Government
during the check period. P. Visalakshi Ponmudi (Respondent
No.2) is his wife, whereas P.Saraswathi (Respondent No.3)
(since deceased) was his mother-in-law. A.Manivannan
(Respondent No.4) and A.Nandagopal (Respondent No.5)
(since deceased) are the friends of the Minister (Respondent
No.1). Respondent Nos. 3 to 5 during their lifetime were
trustees of one Siga
 
Educational Trust, Villupuram.
13. In the present appeals, we have to examine the validity
of the order of discharge passed by the Special Judge as
affirmed by the High Court. Hence, we consider it unnecessary
to go into the details of the case of the prosecution or the
defence of the respondent at this stage. Suffice it to say that,
according to the prosecution, K. Ponmudi (Respondent No.1),
as a Minister of Transport and a Member of the Tamil Nadu
Legislative Assembly during the period from 13.05.1996 to
30.09.2001, had acquired and was in possession of pecuniary
resources and properties in his name and in the names of his
wife and sons, which were disproportionate to his known
sources of income. Accordingly, Crime No. 4 of 2002 was
registered at Cuddalore
 
Village, Anti-Corruption Department on
14th of March, 2002 under Section 109 of the Indian Penal
Code read with Section 13(2) and Section 13(1)(e) of the
Prevention of Corruption Act, hereinafter referred to as ‚the Act™.

and further verification, the Minister was not able to satisfactorily
account for the quantum of disproportionate assets.
Accordingly, the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Department of
the State Government submitted charge-sheet against the
respondents under Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code and
Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the Act.
15. It is relevant here to state that the offences punishable
under the scheme of the Act have to be tried by a Special
Judge and he may take cognizance of the offence without
commitment of the accused and the Judge trying the accused
is required to follow the procedure prescribed by the Code for
the trial of warrant cases by the Magistrate. The Special Judge
holding the trial is deemed to be a Court of Sessions. The
respondents filed petition for discharge under Section 239 of
the Code inter alia contending that the system which the
prosecution had followed to ascertain the income of the
accused is wrong. Initially, the check period was from
10.05.1996 to 13.09.2001 which, during the investigation, was
enlarged from 13.05.1996 to 31.03.2002. Not only this,
according to the accused, the income was undervalued and the
expenditures exaggerated. According to Respondent No. 1, the
Minister, income of the individual property of his wife and that
of his mother-in-law and their expenditure ought not to have
been shown as his property. According to him, the allegation
that the properties in their names are his benami properties is
wrong. It was also contended that the valuation of the properties
has been arrived at without taking into consideration the entire
income and expenditure of Respondent No. 1. Respondents
have also alleged that the investigating officer, who is the
informant of the case, had acted autocratically and his action
is vitiated by bias. The Special Judge examined all these
contentions and by order dated 21st of July, 2004 discharged
Respondents on its finding that the investigation was not
conducted properly. The Special Judge further held that the
value of the property of Respondent Nos. 2 to 5 ought not to
have been clubbed with that of the individual properties and
During the course of investigation it transpired that between the
period from 13.05.1996 to 31.03.2002, the Minister had
acquired and possessed properties at Mathirimangalam,
Kaspakaranai, Kappiampuliyur villages and other places in
Villupuram Taluk, at Vittalapuram village and other places in
Thindivanam Taluk, at Cuddalore and Pondicherry Towns, at
Chennai and Trichy cities and at other places. It is alleged that
respondent No.1-Minister being a public servant committed the
offence of criminal misconduct by acquiring and being in
possession of pecuniary resources and properties in his name
and in the names of his wife, mother-in-law and also in the name
of Siga Educational Trust, held by the other respondents on
behalf of Respondent No. 1, the Minister, which were
disproportionate to his known sources of income to the extent
of Rs.3,08,35,066.97. According to the prosecution, he could
not satisfactorily account for the assets and in this way, the
Minister had committed the offence punishable under Section
13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the Act.
14. In the course of investigation, it further transpired that
during the check period and in the places stated above, other
accused abetted the Minister in the commission of the offence
by him. Respondent No. 2, the wife of the Minister, aided in
commission of the offence by holding on his behalf a substantial
portion of properties and pecuniary resources in her name as
well as in the name of M/s. Visal Expo, of which she was the
sole Proprietor. Similarly, Respondent No. 3, the mother-in-law,
aided the Minister by holding on his behalf a substantial portion
of properties and pecuniary resources in her name as well as
in the name of Siga Educational Trust by purporting to be one
of its Trustees. Similarly, Respondent No. 4 and Respondent
No. 5 aided the Minister and held on his behalf a substantial
portion of the properties and pecuniary resources in the name
of Siga Educational Trust by purporting to be its Trustees. It is
relevant here to mention that during the course of investigation,
the statement of all other accused were taken and in the opinion
of the investigating agency, after due scrutiny of their statements

income of Respondent No. 1 and by doing so, the assets of
Respondent No. 1 cannot be said to be disproportionate to his
known sources of income. On the aforesaid finding the Special
Judge discharged all the accused. Aggrieved by the same, the
State of Tamil Nadu filed separate revision petitions and the
High Court, by the impugned order, has dismissed all the
revision petitions. The High Court, while affirming the order of
discharge, held that the prosecution committed an error by
adding the income of other respondents, who were assessed
under the Income Tax Act, in the income of Respondent No.1.
In the opinion of the High Court, an independent and unbiased
scrutiny of the entire documents furnished along with the final
report would not make out any ground of framing of charges
against any of the accused persons. While doing so, the High
Court has observed as follows:
ﬁ
18
. The assets which admittedly, do not belong to
Accused 1 and owned by individuals having independent
source of income which are assessed under the Income
Tax Act, were added as the assets of Accused -1. Such a
procedure adopted by the prosecution is not only
unsustainable but also illegal. An independent and
unbiased scrutiny of the entire documents furnished along
with the final report would not make out any ground for
framing of charge as against any of the accused persons.
The methodology adopted by the prosecution to establish
the disproportionate assets with reference to the known
source of income is absolutely erroneous.
xxx
xxx
xxx
The theory of Benami is totally alien to the concept of trust
and it is not legally sustainable to array the accused 3 to
5 as holders of the properties or that they are the benamies
of the accused. The benami transaction has to be proved
by the prosecution by producing legally permissible
materials of a bona fide character which would directly
prove the fact of benami and there is a total lack of
materials on this account and hence the theory of benami
has not been established even remotely by any evidence.
On a prima-facie evidence it is evident that the other
accused are possessed of sufficient funds for acquiring
their properties and that A1 has nothing to do with those
properties and that he cannot be called upon to explain the
source of income of the acquisition made by other persons.
19
––– Admittedly the accused are not possessed of
the properties standing in the name of Trust and controlled
by the Accused A3 to A5. The trust is an independent legal
entity assessed to income tax and owning the properties.
Only to boost the value of the assets the prosecution
belatedly arrayed the Trustees of the Trust as accused 3
to 5 in order to foist a false case as against A1.
xxx
xxx
xxx
21
–––All the properties acquired by A2 and A3 in their
individual capacity acquired out of their own income have
been shown in the Income Tax Returns, which fact the
prosecution also knows and also available in the records
of the prosecution. The prosecution has no justification or
reason to disregard those income tax returns to disallow
such income while filing the final report. The documents
now available on record also would clearly disprove the
claim of benami transaction.ﬂ
The High court ultimately concluded as follows:
ﬁ
24
––––Therefore, the trial court analyzing the
materials and documents that were made available at the
stage of framing charges and on their face value arrived
at the right conclusion that charges could not be framed
against the respondents/accused.ﬂ
16. Now we proceed to consider the legal position
concerning the issue of discharge and validity of the orders
impugned in these appeals in the background thereof. Mr. Ranjit

Kumar submits that the order impugned suffers from patent
illegality. He points out that at the time of framing of the charge
the scope is limited and what is to be seen at this stage is as
to whether on examination of the materials and the documents
collected, the charge can be said to be groundless or not. He
submits that at this stage, the court cannot appraise the
evidence as is done at the time of trial. He points out that while
passing the impugned orders, the evidence has been
appraised and the case of the prosecution has been rejected,
as is done after the trial while acquitting the accused.
17. Mr. Sorabjee as also Mr. N.V. Ganesh appearing on
behalf of the respondents-accused, however, submit that when
the court considers the applications for discharge, it has to
examine the materials for the purpose of finding out as to
whether the allegation made is groundless or not. They submit
that at the time of consideration of an application for discharge,
nothing prevents the court to sift and weigh the evidence for the
purpose of ascertaining as to whether the allegations made on
the basis of the materials and the documents collected are
groundless or not. They also contend that the court while
considering such an application cannot act merely as a post-
office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution. In support of the
submission, reliance has been placed on a decision of this
Court in the case of 
Sajjan Kumar v. CBI, 
(2010) 9 SCC 368
and our attention has been drawn to Paragraph 17(4) of the
judgment, which reads as follows:
ﬁ17.
 In 
Union of India v. Prafulla Kumar Samal & Anr.,
1979 (3) SCC 4, the scope of Section 227 CrPC was
considered. After adverting to various decisions, this Court
has enumerated the following principles:
xxx
xxx
xxx
(
4
) That in exercising his jurisdiction under Section 227 of
the Code the Judge which under the present Code is a
senior and experienced court cannot act merely as a post
office or a mouthpiece of the prosecution, but has to
consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect
of the evidence and the documents produced before the
court, any basic infirmities appearing in the case and so
on. This however does not mean that the Judge should
make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter
and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial.ﬂ
18. Yet another decision on which reliance has been
placed is the decision of this Court in the case of 
Dilawar Balu
Kurane v. State of Maharashtra, (
2002) 2 SCC 135, reference
has been made to the following paragraph of the said judgment:
ﬁ12.
 Now the next question is whether a prima facie case
has been made out against the appellant. In exercising
powers under Section 227 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, the settled position of law is that the Judge
while considering the question of framing the charges
under the said section has the undoubted power to sift and
weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out
whether or not a prima facie case against the accused has
been made out; where the materials placed before the
court disclose grave suspicion against the accused which
has not been properly explained the court will be fully
justified in framing a charge and proceeding with the trial;
by and large if two views are equally possible and the
Judge is satisfied that the evidence produced before him
while giving rise to some suspicion but not grave suspicion
against the accused, he will be fully justified to discharge
the accused, and in exercising jurisdiction under Section
227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Judge cannot
act merely as a post office or a mouthpiece of the
prosecution, but has to consider the broad probabilities of
the case, the total effect of the evidence and the documents
produced before the court but should not make a roving
enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the
evidence as if he was conducting a trial.ﬂ

19. We have bestowed our consideration to the rival
submissions and the submissions made by Mr. Ranjit Kumar
commend us. True it is that at the time of consideration of the
applications for discharge, the court cannot act as a
mouthpiece of the prosecution or act as a post-office and may
sift evidence in order to find out whether or not the allegations
made are groundless so as to pass an order of discharge. It
is trite that at the stage of consideration of an application for
discharge, the court has to proceed with an assumption that
the materials brought on record by the prosecution are true and
evaluate the said materials and documents with a view to find
out whether the facts emerging therefrom taken at their face
value disclose the existence of all the ingredients constituting
the alleged offence. At this stage, probative value of the
materials has to be gone into and the court is not expected to
go deep into the matter and hold that the materials would not
warrant a conviction. In our opinion, what needs to be
considered is whether there is a ground for presuming that the
offence has been committed and not whether a ground for
convicting the accused has been made out. To put it differently,
if the court thinks that the accused might have committed the
offence on the basis of the materials on record on its probative
value, it can frame the charge; though for conviction, the court
has to come to the conclusion that the accused has committed
the offence. The law does not permit a mini trial at this stage.
Reference in this connection can be made to a recent decision
of this Court in the case of Sheoraj Singh Ahlawat & Ors. vs.
State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr., AIR 2013 SC 52, in which, after
analyzing various decisions on the point, this Court endorsed
the following view taken in 
Onkar Nath Mishra v. State (NCT
of Delhi), 
(2008) 2 SCC 561:
ﬁ
11
. It is trite that at the stage of framing of charge the court
is required to evaluate the material and documents on
record with a view to finding out if the facts emerging there
from, taken at their face value, disclosed the existence of
all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. At that
stage, the court is not expected to go deep into the
probative value of the material on record. What needs to
be considered is whether there is a ground for presuming
that the offence has been committed and not a ground for
convicting the accused has been made out. At that stage,
even strong suspicion founded on material which leads the
court to form a presumptive opinion as to the existence of
the factual ingredients constituting the offence alleged
would justify the framing of charge against the accused in
respect of the commission of that offence.ﬂ
20. Now reverting to the decisions of this Court in the case
Sajjan Kumar (supra)
 and 
Dilawar Balu Kurane (supra), 
relied
on by the respondents, we are of the opinion that they do not
advance their case. The aforesaid decisions consider the
provision of Section 227 of the Code and make it clear that at
the stage of discharge the Court can not make a roving enquiry
into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the evidence
as if it was conducting a trial. It is worth mentioning that the
Code contemplates discharge of the accused by the Court of
Sessions under Section 227 in a case triable by it; cases
instituted upon a police report are covered by Section 239 and
cases instituted otherwise than on a police report are dealt with
in Section 245. From a reading of the aforesaid sections it is
evident that they contain somewhat different provisions with
regard to discharge of an accused. Under Section 227 of the
Code, the trial court is required to discharge the accused if it
ﬁconsiders that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding
against the accusedﬂ. However, discharge under Section 239
can be ordered when ﬁthe Magistrate considers the charge
against the accused to be groundlessﬂ. The power to discharge
is exercisable under Section 245(1) when, ﬁthe Magistrate
considers, for reasons to be recorded that no case against the
accused has been made out which, if not repudiated, would
warrant his convictionﬂ. Section 227 and 239 provide for
discharge before the recording of evidence on the basis of the
police report, the documents sent along with it and examination

of the accused after giving an opportunity to the parties to be
heard. However, the stage of discharge under Section 245, on
the other hand, is reached only after the evidence referred in
Section 244 has been taken. Thus, there is difference in the
language employed in these provisions. But, in our opinion,
notwithstanding these differences, and whichever provision may
be applicable, the court is required at this stage to see that
there is a prima facie case for proceeding against the accused.
Reference in this connection can be made to a judgment of this
Court in the case of 
R.S. Nayak v. A.R. Antulay, (1986) 2 SCC
716
. The same reads as follows:
ﬁ43––––––Notwithstanding this difference in the
position there is no scope for doubt that the stage at which
the magistrate is required to consider the question of
framing of charge under Section 245(1) is a preliminary
one and the test of ﬁprima facieﬂ case has to be applied.
In spite of the difference in the language of the three
sections, the legal position is that if the Trial court is
satisfied that a prima facie case is made out, charge has
to be framed.ﬂ
21. 
Bearing in mind the principles aforesaid, we proceed
to consider the facts of the present case. Here the allegation
against the accused Minister (Respondent No.1), K. Ponmudi
is that while he was a Member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative
Assembly and a State Minister, he had acquired and was in
possession of the properties in the name of his wife as also
his mother-in-law, who along with his other friends, were of Siga
Educational Trust, Villupuram. According to the prosecution, the
properties of Siga Educational Trust, Villupuram were held by
other accused on behalf of the accused Minister. These
properties, according to the prosecution, in fact, were the
properties of K.Ponumudi. Similarly, accused N. Suresh Rajan
has acquired properties disproportionate to his known sources
of income in the names of his father and mother. While passing
the order of discharge, the fact that the accused other than the
two Ministers have been assessed to income tax and paid
income tax cannot be relied upon to discharge the accused
persons particularly in view of the allegation made by the
prosecution that there was no separate income to amass such
huge properties. The property in the name of an income tax
assessee itself cannot be a ground to hold that it actually
belongs to such an assessee. In case this proposition is
accepted, in our opinion, it will lead to disastrous
consequences. It will give opportunity to the corrupt public
servants to amass property in the name of known persons, pay
income tax on their behalf and then be out from the mischief of
law. While passing the impugned orders, the court has not sifted
the materials for the purpose of finding out whether or not there
is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused but
whether that would warrant a conviction. We are of the opinion
that this was not the stage where the court should have
appraised the evidence and discharged the accused as if it
was passing an order of acquittal. Further, defect in investigation
itself cannot be a ground for discharge. In our opinion, the order
impugned suffers from grave error and calls for rectification.
22. Any observation made by us in this judgment is for the
purpose of disposal of these appeals and shall have no bearing
on the trial. The surviving respondents are directed to appear
before the respective courts on 3rd of February, 2014. The Court
shall proceed with the trial from the stage of charge in
accordance with law and make endeavour to dispose of the
same expeditiously.
23. In the result, we allow these appeals and set aside the
order of discharge with the aforesaid observation.

The instant appeal arose out of the order of the High
Court, whereby it affirmed the award of the Industrial
Tribunal directing payment of Hill Development Allowance
after taking into account the amounts received as ﬁleave
encashment and overtime wages.ﬂ The case of the
employer was that the workmen would be entitled to 15%
of the basic wages only as Hill Development Allowance.
Allowing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 
1.1. Hill Development Allowance is nothing
but a compensatory allowance. A compensatory
allowance broadly falls into three categories; (i) allowance
to meet the high cost of living in certain, specially costly
cities and other local areas; (ii) allowance to compensate
for the hardship of service in certain areas, e.g. areas
which have a bad climate and/or difficult to access; and
(iii) allowances granted in areas, e.g. field service areas,
where, because of special conditions of living or service,
an employee cannot, besides other disadvantages, have
his family with him. In the instant case, it seems that
taking into account bad climate and remote and difficult
access, the decision was taken to grant the Hill
Development Allowance at the rate of 15% of the basic
wage. [para 5] [161-F-H; 162-A-B]
1.2. When an expression is not defined, one can take
into account the definition given to such expression in a
statute as also the dictionary meaning. The expression
‚basic wage™ has not been explained by the Government
in the Order granting Hill Development Allowance. It has
been defined only u/s 2(b) of the Employees™ Provident
Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. The term
‚basic wage™ has also been defined in Merriam Webster
Dictionary.
 
This Court, therefore, holds that those wages
which are universally, necessarily and ordinarily paid to
all the employees across the board are basic wage.

of 2014.
From the Judgment & Order dated 24.06.2008 of the High
Court of Uttarakhand in WPMS No. 3717 of 2001.
Tanmaya Agarwal, Vinay Garg for the Appellant.
Jatin Zaveri (A.C.) for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
CHANDRAMAULI KR. PRASAD, J.
 1. Kichha Sugar
Company Limited aggrieved by the order dated 24th of June,
2008 passed by the Uttarakhand High Court in WPMS No.
3717 of 2001, affirming the award dated 12th of November,
1992 directing payment of Hill Development Allowance after
taking into account the amount received as ﬁleave encashment
and overtime wagesﬂ, has preferred this special leave petition.
2. Leave granted.
3. Facts lie in a narrow compass;
4. The Government of Uttar Pradesh, by its order dated
5th of January, 1981, had directed for payment of Hill
Development Allowance to its employees working at specified
hill areas at the rate of 15% of the basic wage. Kichha Sugar
Company Limited, the appellant herein (hereinafter referred to
as ‚the employer™), being a unit of a subsidiary of U.P.
Government Corporation, adopted the same and started paying
Hill Development Allowance at the rate of 15% of the basic
wage. The workmen demanded calculation of 15% of the said
allowance by taking into account the amount paid as overtime,
leave encashment and all other allowances. When the employer
did not agree to the calculation of the Hill Development
Allowance as suggested by the workmen, a dispute was raised.
It was referred to conciliation and on its failure, the competent
Government made the following reference.
Whether the exclusion of payment of overtime, leave
encashment, bonus and retaining allowance while
calculating the Hill Development Allowance by the
Employer is legal and justified? If not, to what relief, the
workmen concerned are entitled to get?
It is common ground that while calculating Hill

Development Allowance, the employer has not taken into
account any other amount including amount received as bonus,
leave encashment, retaining allowance or overtime wages. It
is the claim of the workmen that 15% of the Hill Development
Allowance is to be calculated and paid after taking into account
the payments made under the aforesaid headings. The
employer repudiated their claim and according to it, the
workmen shall be entitled to 15% of the basic wages as Hill
Development Allowance. The Industrial Tribunal gave
opportunity to both the employer and the workmen to file their
claim and produce material and on consideration of the same,
gave award dated 12th of November, 1992 directing the
employer to ﬁgive Hill Development Allowance to their
permanent and regular workers on the amount received
regarding leave encashment and overtime wages.ﬂ However,
the Tribunal observed that ﬁHill Development Allowance shall
not be payable on bonus and retaining allowance or on any
other allowancesﬂ. The employer, aggrieved by the award
preferred writ petition before the High Court, which affirmed the
same without any discussion or assigning any reason in the
following words:
ﬁ9. After going through the aforesaid finding recorded by
the tribunal concerned, I find no infirmity or illegality in the
impugned award passed by the tribunal concerned and the
same is hereby confirmed.ﬂ
5. Before we enter into the merit of the case, it is apt to
understand what Hill Development Allowance is. In our opinion,
Hill Development Allowances is nothing but a compensatory
allowance. A compensatory allowance broadly falls into three
categories; (i) allowance to meet the high cost of living in
certain, specially costly cities and other local areas; (ii)
allowance to compensate for the hardship of service in certain
areas, e.g. areas which have a bad climate and/or difficult to
access; and (iii) allowances granted in areas, e.g. field service
areas, where, because of special conditions of living or service,
an employee cannot, besides other disadvantages, have his
family with him. There may be cases in which more than one
of these conditions for grant of compensatory allowance is
fulfilled. It seems that taking into account bad climate and
remote and difficult access, the decision was taken to grant the
Hill Development Allowance at the rate of 15% of the basic
wage.
6. We have heard Mr. Tanmaya Agarwal for the appellant
and Mr. Jatin Zaveri for the respondent. Mr. Agarwal submits
that basic wage will not include the amount received as leave
encashment and overtime wages. According to him, basic wage
would mean the wage which is paid to all the employees. He
submits that leave encashment and overtime wages would vary
from workman to workman and, therefore, those cannot be
included in the basic wage. In support of the submission he
placed reliance on a judgment of this Court in the case of 
Muir
Mills Co. Ltd. v. Workmen, 
AIR 1960 SC 985 and our attention
has been drawn to the following passage from Paragraph 11
of the judgment, which reads as follows:
ﬁ11.
 Thus understood ﬁbasic wageﬂ never includes the
additional emoluments which some workmen may earn, on
the basis of a system of bonuses related to the production.
The quantum of earnings in such bonuses varies from
individual to individual according to their efficiency and
diligence; it will vary sometimes from season to season
with the variations of working conditions in the factory or
other place where the work is done; it will vary also with
variations in the rate of supplies of raw material or in the
assistance obtainable from machinery. This very element
of variation, excludes this part of workmen™s emoluments
from the connotation of ﬁbasic wagesﬂ.ﬂ
7. 
Mr. Garg, however submits that any amount including
the amount paid as leave encashment and overtime wages do
come within the expression ‚basic wage™ and, hence, have to

9. 
According to 
http://www.merriam-webster.com
 (Merriam
Webster Dictionary) the word ‚basic wage™ means as follows:
ﬁ1. A wage or salary based on the cost of living and used
as a standard for calculating rates of pay
2. A rate of pay for a standard work period exclusive of
such additional payments as bonuses and overtime.ﬂ
10. When an expression is not defined, one can take into
account the definition given to such expression in a statute as
also the dictionary meaning. In our opinion, those wages which
are universally, necessarily and ordinarily paid to all the
employees across the board are basic wage. Where the
payment is available to those who avail the opportunity more
than others, the amount paid for that cannot be included in the
basic wage. As for example, the overtime allowance, though it
is generally enforced across the board but not earned by all
employees equally. Overtime wages or for that matter, leave
encashment may be available to each workman but it may vary
from one workman to other. The extra bonus depends upon the
extra hour of work done by the workman whereas leave
encashment shall depend upon the number of days of leave
available to workman. Both are variable. In view of what we have
observed above, we are of the opinion that the amount received
as leave encashment and overtime wages is not fit to be
included for calculating 15% of the Hill Development Allowance.
The view which we have taken finds support from the judgment
of this Court in 
Muir Mills Co. Ltd.
 (supra), relied on by the
appellant, in which it has been specifically held that the basic
wage shall not include bonus.
11. It also finds support from a judgment of this Court in
the case of 
Manipal Academy of Higher Education v.
Provident Fund Commr
.,(2008) 5 SCC 428 in which it has
been held as follows:
ﬁ10.
 The basic principles as laid down in 
Bridge & Roofs
be accounted for the purpose of calculating 15% of the basic
pay.
8. 
In view of the rival submissions, the question which falls
for our determination is as to the meaning of the expression
‚basic wage™. The expression ‚basic wage™ has not been
explained by the Government in the order granting Hill
Development Allowance. It has been defined only under
Section 2(b) of the Employees™ Provident Funds and
Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. Therefore, we have to see
what meaning is to be given to this expression in the present
context. Section 2(b) of the Employees™ Provident Funds and
Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 defines ‚basic wages™ as
follows:

case,

Sections 2(
b
) and 6 are as follows:
(
a
) Where the wage is universally, necessarily and
ordinarily paid to all across the board such emoluments
are basic wages.
(
b
) Where the payment is available to be specially paid to
those who avail of the opportunity is not basic wages. By
way of example it was held that overtime allowance, though
it is generally in force in all concerns is not earned by all
employees of a concern. It is also earned in accordance
with the terms of the contract of employment but because
it may not be earned by all employees of a concern, it is
excluded from basic wages.
(
c
) Conversely, any payment by way of a special incentive
or work is not basic wages.ﬂ
12. 
In view of what we have observed above, the impugned
award and the judgment of the High Court are illegal and cannot
be allowed to stand.
13. In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the award
and the judgment of the High Court and hold that overtime
allowance and leave encashment are not fit to be taken into
account for calculating the Hill Development Allowance. No

Held: High Court should not interfere with a concurrent finding
of fact unless it is perverse.
The appellant purchased a building, which included
a room (suit premises) occupied by the respondent as a
tenant. The respondent was informed of the transaction.
When in spite of notice, the respondent did not pay the
rent, the appellant filed a suit under the M.P.
Accommodation Control Act, 1961 on the grounds of non-
payment of rent, denial of title, bona fide need etc. The
respondent filed a written statement denying the title of
the appellant, any attornement between the parties as also
any landlord-tenant relationship between him and the
appellant. He even denied the genuineness of the sale
deed. The trial court recorded a finding that the
respondent-tenant denied the title of the appellant-
landlady and, accordingly, decreed the suit u/s 12(1)(c)
of the Act. The decree was confirmed by the first
appellate court. However, the High Court set aside the
eviction decree holding that in the facts of the case no
decree u/s 12(1)(c) of the Act could be passed.
Disposing of the appeal, the Court
HELD: 
1.1. It is well settled that the High Court should
not interfere with a concurrent finding of fact unless it is
perverse. In the instant case, there is no perversity in the
concurrent finding of fact returned by the courts below
warranting the High Court™s interference. [Para 9] [173-B]

1.2. Under s. 111(g) of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882, the lease is determined by forfeiture, if the lessee
denies the lessor™s title. Denial of landlord™s title or
disclaimer of tenancy by tenant is an act which is likely
to affect adversely and substantially the interest of the
landlord. It is, therefore, covered by s. 12(1)(c) of the M.P.

refused to acknowledge the appellant™s title. He denied
it in his written statement and evidence. The High Court
has accepted that in his cross-examination the
respondent has stated that he was not accepting the
appellant as his landlady. Even denial of a landlord™s title
in the written statement can provide a ground for eviction
of a tenant. It is also settled position in law that it is not
necessary that the denial of title by the landlord should
be anterior to the institution of eviction proceedings.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 106
of 2014.
From the Judgment & Order dated 03.08.2010 of the High
Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench at Indore in Second Appeal
No. 756 of 2004.
Ardhendumauli Kumar Prasad, Aviral Shukla, Nirnimesh

Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by

 1. Leave
granted.
2. This appeal, by grant of special leave, is directed
against the judgment and order dated 03/08/2010 passed by
the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench at Indore allowing
Second Appeal No. 756 of 2004 filed by the respondent.
3. Briefly put, the facts are that the appellant-landlady
purchased House No. 1/2, Street No. 6, Parsi Mohallah, Indore
(‚the said building™)
 from M/s. Pyare Mohan Khar, Hari Mohan
Khar, Shayam Sunder Khar and Anil Khar predecessors-in-title
of the appellant by a registered sale deed dated 26/9/1991 for
a consideration of Rs. 1,70,000/-. At the time of purchase of
the said building, the respondent-tenant was occupying one
room (
‚suit premises™
) situated on the rear side of the said
building as tenant. The respondent was informed by the
predecessors-in-title of the appellant that the appellant is the
new landlady of the said building and he should pay the rent to
her. The respondent agreed to pay the rent but failed to pay it.
Failure of the respondent to pay the rent resulted in a notice

Mr. Prasad submitted that it is clearly established from
the evidence on record that the respondent had denied the title
of the appellant and, therefore, the case clearly falls within the
ambit of Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act. The eviction decree
was, therefore, correctly passed by the trial court and confirmed
by the first appellate court. In this connection he relied on
Devasahyam v. P. Savithramma

, State of Andgra Pradesh
& Ors. v. D. Raghukul Pershad(dead) by LRs.& Ors
5
. and
Bhogadi Kannababu & Ors. v. Vuggina Pydamma & Ors.

.
Counsel submitted that in the circumstances the impugned
order be set aside.
8. Shri Amit Pawan, learned counsel for the respondent,
on the other hand submitted that attornment of tenancy to the
appellant is not proved. Counsel submitted that the respondent
had no knowledge about the sale transaction that allegedly took
place between the appellant and Shri Khar, under which the
appellant is said to have purchased the suit premises. This is
a case of derivative title which the tenant can deny if he had
no knowledge of the sale transaction. Counsel submitted that
the trial court and lower appellate court ignored this vital legal
position and, therefore, the High Court rightly set aside the
eviction decree. Counsel relied on 
Mohd. Nooman & Ors. v.
Mohd. Jabed Alam & Ors.

 in support of his submission that
being sent by the appellant to him on 23/11/2002, but despite
the notice the respondent did not pay the rent.
4. On 06/1/2003, the appellant filed a suit for eviction of
the respondent under the M.P. Accommodation Control Act,
1961 
(‚the M.P. Act™) 
on grounds of non-payment of rent, denial
of the appellant™s title by the respondent, bona fide need for
residential purpose and reconstruction of the said building as
it had become unsafe for human habitation. It was specifically
averred in the plaint that the appellant had purchased the said
building vide a registered document on 26/9/1991.
5. The respondent contested the said suit and filed a
written statement denying the title of the appellant as well as
the grounds on which his eviction from the suit premises was
sought. The respondent denied that there was any attornement
between the parties and that there was a landlord-tenant
relationship between him and the appellant. He claimed to be
tenant of the earlier landlord Shri Khar. He contended that he
had never paid any rent to the appellant. He denied the
genuineness of the registered sale deed dated 26/9/1991.
6. The trial court decreed the suit under Section 12(1)(c)
of the M.P. Act. The suit was dismissed so far as the other
grounds are concerned. The trial court™s judgment was
confirmed by the first appellate court. The High Court by the
impugned order set aside the eviction decree passed by the
courts below holding that in the facts of the case no decree
under Section 12 (1) (c) of the M.P. Act could be passed. The
controversy, therefore, revolves around Section 12(1)(c) of the
M.P. Act in the context of the facts of this case.
7. Shri Ardhendumauli Kumar Prasad, learned counsel for
the appellant, submitted that both the courts having concurrently
found that the landlord was entitled to a decree of eviction under
Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act and since there was no
perversity attached to the said finding, the High Court ought not
to have interfered with it while dealing with a second appeal,

within the ambit of Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act. Under
Section 111(g) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the lease
is determined by forfeiture, if the lessee denies the lessor™s title.
While dealing with eviction suit, arising out of the M.P. Act, in
Devasahayam,
 this Court has held that so just is the above rule
that in various rent control legislations such a ground is
recognized and incorporated as a ground for eviction of a
tenant either expressly or impliedly within the net of an act
injurious to the interest of the landlord. It is further held that
denial of landlord™s title or disclaimer of tenancy by tenant is
an act which is likely to affect adversely and substantially the
interest of the landlord. It is, therefore, covered by Section
12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act. The following observations of this Court
in 
Devasahayam 
are relevant:
ﬁ
27
.
 In 
Sheela v. Prahlad Rai Prem Prakash
8
 whereupon
Mr. Nageswara Rao placed strong reliance, Lahoti, J., as
the learned Chief Justice then was, while construing the
provisions of clause (
c
) of sub-section (1) of Section 12
of the M.P. Accommodation Control Act, 1961 observed:
13. The law as to tenancy being determined by forfeiture
by denial of the lessor™s title or disclaimer of the tenancy
has been adopted in India from the law of England where
it originated as a principle in consonance with justice,
equity and good conscience. On enactment of the Transfer
of Property Act, 1882, the same was incorporated into
clause (
g
) of Section 111. So just is the rule that it has
been held applicable even in the areas where the Transfer
of Property Act does not apply. (See: 
Raja Mohammad
Amir Ahmad Khan v. Municipal Board of Sitapur
9
.) The
principle of determination of tenancy by forfeiture
consequent upon denial of the lessor™s title may not be
applicable where rent control legislation intervenes and
such legislation while extending protection to tenants from
the issue regarding title can be decided in an eviction suit and,
therefore, it was correctly raised by the respondent.
9. It is well settled by a long line of judgments of this Court
that the High Court should not interfere with a concurrent finding
of fact unless it is perverse. (See: 
Deep Chandra Juneja
,
Yash Pal
 & 
Firojuddin
). In this case, for the reasons which we
shall soon record, we are unable to find any such perversity in
the concurrent finding of fact returned by the courts below
warranting the High Court™s interference.
10. The trial court passed the decree under Section 12
(1)(c) of the M.P. Act on the ground that the respondent-tenant
denied the title of the appellant-landlady. It was confirmed by
the first appellate court. It is, therefore, necessary to reproduce
Section 12(1) (c) of the M.P. Act. It reads as under:
ﬁ12. Restriction on eviction of tenants.Š(1) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in any other law or
contract, no suit shall be filed in any civil court against a
tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except on
one or more of the following grounds only, namelyŠ
(a) xxx
(b) xxx
(c) that the tenant or any person residing with him has
created nuisance or has done any act which is inconsistent
with the purpose for which he was admitted to the tenancy
of the accommodation, or which is likely to affect adversely
and substantially the interest of the landlord therein:
Provided that the use by a tenant of a portion of the
accommodation as his office shall not be deemed to be
an act inconsistent with the purpose for which he was
admitted to the tenancy;ﬂ

eviction does not recognise such denial or disclaimer as
a ground for termination of tenancy and eviction of tenant.
However, in various rent control legislations such a ground
is recognised and incorporated as a ground for eviction
of tenant either expressly or impliedly by bringing it within
the net of an act injurious to the interest of the landlord on
account of its mischievous content to prejudice adversely
and substantially the interest of the landlord.
– – – –
– – – –
17
. In our opinion, denial of landlord™s title or disclaimer
of tenancy by tenant is an act which is likely to affect
adversely and substantially the interest of the landlord and
hence is a ground for eviction of tenant within the meaning
of clause (
c
) of sub-section (1) of Section 12 of the M.P.
Accommodation Control Act, 1961. To amount to such
denial or disclaimer, as would entail forfeiture of tenancy
rights and incur the liability to be evicted, the tenant should
have renounced his character as tenant and in clear and
unequivocal terms set up title of the landlord in himself or
in a third party. A tenant bona fide calling upon the landlord
to prove his ownership or putting the landlord to proof of
his title so as to protect himself (i.e. the tenant) or to earn
a protection made available to him by the rent control law
but without disowning his character of possession over the
tenancy premises as tenant cannot be said to have denied
the title of landlord or disclaimed the tenancy. Such an act
of the tenant does not attract applicability of Section
12(1)(
c
) abovesaid. It is the intention of the tenant, as
culled out from the nature of the plea raised by him, which
is determinative of its vulnerability.ﬂ
12. Having ascertained the legal position we will now state
why we feel that the High Court is not right in disturbing the
concurrent finding of fact that the respondent-tenant denied the
title of the appellant-landlady.
13. There is a specific reference to the registered
document under which the appellant purchased the suit building
from the earlier landlord in the plaint. Yet, in the written statement
the respondent denied the title of the appellant. We notice that
there are several documents on record relating to the
ownership of the appellant, apart from the registered sale deed,
such as municipal tax receipts, ration card etc. Yet, the
respondent refused to acknowledge the appellant™s title. He
denied it in his evidence. This is not a simple case of denial of
derivative title by a person who did not know about the purchase
of the building by the landlord. Even after going through the
relevant documents relating to the appellant™s title the
respondent feigned ignorance about it. The High Court has
accepted that in his cross-examination the respondent has
stated that he was not accepting the appellant as his landlady.
The High Court has, however, gone on to say that by this piece
of evidence no decree of eviction can be passed against the
respondent under Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act because the
respondent will have no occasion to establish in what
circumstances he denied the title of the appellant. The High
Court has further held that the respondent was within
permissible limit in asking the appellant to produce
documentary evidence about his title as a landlord. The High
Court, in our opinion, fell into a grave error in drawing such a
conclusion. Even denial of a landlord™s title in the written
statement can provide a ground for eviction of a tenant. It is also
settled position in law that it is not necessary that the denial of
title by the landlord should be anterior to the institution of eviction
proceedings. This is so stated by this Court in 
Majati Subbarao
v. P.V.K. Krishnarao(deceased) by LRs.
10
.
14. The High Court has expressed that the respondent
was justified in asking the appellant to produce the documents.

KESHAR BAI 
v
. CHHUNULAL
[RANJANA PRAKASH DESAI, J.]
Implicit in this observation is the High Court™s view that the
respondent could have in an eviction suit got the title of the
appellant finally adjudicated upon. There is a fallacy in this
reasoning. In eviction proceedings the question of title to the
properties in question may be incidentally gone into, but cannot
be decided finally. Similar question fell for consideration of this
Court in 
Bhagadi Kannabalu.
 In that case it was argued that
the landlady was not entitled to inherit the properties in question
and hence could not maintain the application for eviction on the
ground of default and sub-letting under the A.P. Tenancy Act.
This Court referred to its decision in 
Tej Bhan Madan v. II
Additional District Judge and Ors.
11
 in which it was held that a
tenant was precluded from denying the title of the landlady on
the general principle of estoppel between landlord and tenant
and that this principle, in its basic foundations, means no more
than that under certain circumstances law considers it unjust to
allow a person to approbate and reprobate. Section 116 of the
Evidence Act is clearly applicable to such a situation. This
Court held that even if the landlady was not entitled to inherit
the properties in question, she could still maintain the
application for eviction and the finding of fact recorded by the
courts below in favour of the landlady was not liable to be
disturbed. The position on law was stated by this Court as
under:
ﬁIn this connection, we may also point out that in an eviction
petition filed on the ground of sub-letting and default, the
court needs to decide whether relationship of landlord and
tenant exists and not the question of title to the properties
in question, which may be incidentally gone into, but cannot
be decided finally in the eviction proceeding.ﬂ
15. Reliance placed by learned counsel for the respondent
on 
Mohd. Nooman
 is misplaced. In that case, the landlord had
filed an eviction suit described as Title Suit No.36 of 1973 to
evict the tenant. The trial court held that the relationship of
landlord and tenant had not been proved and since the tenant
had raised the question of title the proper course would be to
dismiss the suit and not to convert it into a declaratory suit
because the suit was neither for declaration of title nor had the
plaintiff paid 
ad valorem
 court fee. The trial court dismissed
the suit as there was no landlord and tenant relationship, but,
upheld the plaintiff™s claim of title. In the appeal, the first
appellate court observed that by filing a suit for eviction and
paying court fee on twelve months alleged rent, the plaintiff had
adopted a tricky way of getting the title decided. The plaintiff,
then, filed a suit on title. The trial court decreed the suit. The
first appellate court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit.
In the second appeal before the High Court the question was
whether the judgment and decree regarding title passed in the
earlier suit shall operate as 
res judicata 
between the parties
on the question of title. The High Court observed that pleas
taken by both parties regarding title in both the title suits are
the same and answered the question in affirmative. This Court
endorsed the High Court™s view and held that the issue of title
was directly and substantially an issue between the parties in
the earlier eviction suit, hence, the High Court was right in
holding that the finding of title recorded in the earlier suit would
operate as 
res judicata
 in the subsequent suit. This view was
expressly restricted by this Court to the facts before it. This
Court clarified that ordinarily it is true that in a suit for eviction
even if the court goes into the question of title it examines the
issue in an ancillary manner and in such cases (which constitute
a very large majority) any observation or finding on the question
of title would certainly not be binding in any subsequent suit on
the dispute of title. This Court further clarified that the case with
which it was dealing fell in an exceptional category of very
limited number of cases. Thus, in our opinion, no parallel can
be drawn from 
Mohd. Nooman
. In that case issue of title was
framed. In the instant case issue of title was not even framed.
Mohd. Nooman
 arose out of exceptional facts and must be
restricted to those facts.

16. In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the High
Court was wrong in setting aside the concurrent finding of fact
recorded by the courts below that the respondent had denied
the title of the appellant. We are of the view that the present
case is covered by Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act. It is,
therefore, necessary to restore the decree of eviction. In the
circumstances, we allow the appeal. The impugned judgment
of the High Court is set aside and eviction decree passed by
the trial court and confirmed by the first appellate court under
Section 12(1)(c) of the M.P. Act is restored.

relied on sale deeds, Setwar of 1353 Fasli (Ext. A-3) and
the family partition and settlement deed dated 11.12.1939
(Ext. A-2) pertaining to the family of the Pattedar.
Defendant No. 3 filed a written statement stating that the
suit land belonged to defendant no. 1 and it was locally
managed and possessed by defendant No.3. The trial
court decreed the suit. The High Court, in appeal,
affirmed the judgment and decree, but noticing that the
defendants had made large scale construction of
quarters for the Defence Accounts Department, afforded
an opportunity to them to provide alternative suitable
extent of land in lieu of the suit scheduled land.
Allowing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 
1.1. It is trite law that in a suit for declaration
of title, burden always lies on the plaintiff to make out and
establish a clear case for granting such a declaration and
the weakness, if any, of the case set up by the defendants
would not be a ground to grant relief to the plaintiff. The
plaintiff in a suit for declaration of title and possession
can succeed only on the strength of his own title and that
can be done only by adducing sufficient evidence to
discharge the onus on him, irrespective of the question
whether the defendant has proved his case or not. Even
if the title set up by the defendants is found against, in the
absence of establishment of plaintiff™s own title, plaintiff
must be non-suited.[para 12 and 15] [191-G; 192-G]

1.2. In the instant case, the trial court as well as the
High Court rather than examining in depth, the question,
as to whether the plaintiffs have succeeded in
establishing their title on the scheduled suit land, went
on to examine in depth the weakness of the defendants;
title. The defendants relied on the entries in the GLR and
their possession or re-possession over the suit land to
non-suit the plaintiffs. The court went on to examine the
correctness and evidentiary value of the entries in the
GLR in the context of the history and scope of
Cantonment Act, 1924 and the Cantonment Land
Administration Rules, 1925 and tried to establish that no
reliance could be placed on the GLR. The question is not
whether the GLR could be accepted or not, the question
is, whether the plaintiff could prove its title over the suit
property. The entries in the GLR by themselves may not
constitute title, but the question is whether entries made
in Ext.A-3 (Setwar of 1353 Fasli) relied upon by the plaintiff
would confer title on the plaintiff. [para 16] [192-H; 193-
A-C]
1.3. This Court in several Judgments has held that
the revenue records do not confer title. Even if the entries
in the Record of Rights carry evidentiary value, that itself
would not confer any title on the plaintiff over the suit
land. Ext.X-1 is Classer Register of 1347 Fasli which
according to the trial court, speaks of the ownership of
the plaintiff™s vendor™s property. These entries, as such,
would not confer any title. Plaintiffs have to show,
independent of those entries that the plaintiff™s
predecessors-in-interest had title over the property in
question and it is that property which they have
purchased. The only document that has been produced
before the court was the registered family settlement and
partition deed dated 11.12.1939 wherein, admittedly, the
suit land in question has not been mentioned. [para 17

1.4. The plaintiff has also maintained the stand that

1.5. As regards the plea of the respondents-plaintiffs
that the land in question is pot kharab, the A.P. Survey
and Settlement Mannual, Chapter XIII deals with pot
kharab land, which is generally a non-cultivable land and
if the plaintiff™s predecessor in interest had ownership
over this pot kharab land, it should have reference in the
family settlement and partition deed dated 11.12.1939.
Admittedly, the predecessor in interest of the plaintiff got
the property through the family settlement and partition
deed. Conspicuous absence of the suit land in the deed
would cast doubt about the ownership and title of the
plaintiffs over it. [para 21] [194-G-H; 195-A]
1.6. A family settlement is based generally on the
assumption that there was an antecedent title of some
kind in the purchase and the arrangement acknowledges
and defines what that title was. In a family settlement-
cum-partition, the parties may define the shares in the
joint property and may either choose to divide the
property by metes and bounds or may continue to live
together and enjoy the property as common. Ext.A-2 is
totally silent as to whose share the suit land will fall and
who will enjoy it. The burden is on the plaintiff to explain
away those factors, but it has not succeeded. [para 22]

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
K.S. RADHAKRISHNAN, J.
 1. The Vasavi Co-op.
Housing Society Ltd., the first respondent herein instituted a
suit No.794 of 1988 before the City Civil Court, Hyderabad,
seeking a declaration of title over land comprising 6 acres 30
guntas in Survey No.60/1 and 61 of Kakaguda village and
recovery of the vacant possession from Defendant Nos.1 to 3
and 7, the appellants herein, after removal of the structure made
therein by them. The plaintiff has also sought for an injunction
restraining the defendants from interfering with the above-
mentioned land and also for other consequential refliefs. The
City Civil Court vide its judgment dated 31.07.1996 decreed
the suit, as prayed for, against which the appellants preferred
C.C.C.A. No.123 of 1996 before the High Court of Andhra
Pradesh at Hyderabad. The High Court also affirmed the
judgment of the trial Court on 6.9.2002, but noticed that the
appellant had made large scale construction of quarters for the
Defence Accounts Department, therefore, it would be in the
interest of justice that an opportunity be given to the appellants
to provide alternative suitable extent of land in lieu of the
scheduled suit land, for which eight months™ time was granted
from the date of the judgment. Aggrieved by the same, the Union
of India and others have filed the present appeal.
FACTS
2. The plaintiff™s case is that it had purchased the land
situated in Survey Nos.60, 61 and 62 of Kakaguda Village from
Pattedar B.M. Rama Reddy and his sons and others during the
year 1981-82. The suit land in question forms part of Survey
Nos.60 and 61. The suit land in question belonged to the family
of B. Venkata Narasimha Reddy consisting of himself and his
sons Anna Reddy, B.V. Pulla Reddy and B.M. Rama Reddy
and Anna Reddy™s son Prakash Reddy. Land in old Survey
No.53 was allotted to Rama Reddy vide registered family
settlement and partition deed dated 11.12.1939 (Ex.A2). In the
subsequent re-settlement of village (Setwar of 1353 FASLI), the
land in Survey No.53 was re-numbered as Survey No.60, 61
and 62. Ever since the allotment in the family partition of the
above-mentioned land, vide the family partition deed dated
19.03.1939, Rama Reddy had been in exclusive possession
and enjoyment and was paying land revenue. Rama Reddy™s
name was also mutated in the Pahanies.
3. Plaintiffs further stated that the first defendant had it™s
A.O.C. Centre building complex in Tirumalagiri village adjoining
the suit land Survey No.60 of Kakaguda village. The first
defendant had also requisitioned 4 acres and 28 guntas in
Survey No.60 of Kakaguda Village in the year 1971 along with
the adjoining land in Tirumalagiri for extension of A.O.C. Centre.
Further, it was stated that 6th Defendant took possession of
the above-mentioned land and delivered possession of the
same to other defendants. The 3rd Defendant later vide his letter
dated 18.12.1979 sent a requisition for acquisition of 4.38
guntas in Surevy No.60 for the extension of A.O.C. Centre.
Notification was published in the official Gazette dated
18.09.1980 and a declaration was made on 30.06.1981 and
compensation was awarded to Rama Reddy vide Award dated
26.07.1982.
4. The Plaintiffs, as already stated, had entered into
various sale deeds with Rama Reddy during the year 1981-82

by which land measuring 13 acres and 08 guntas in Survey
No.60, 11 acres and 04 guntas in Survey No.61 and 17 acres
and 20 guntas in Survey No.62 were purchased, that is in all
41 acres and 32 guntas. Plaintiffs further stated that the land,
which was purchased by it was vacant, but persons of the
Defence Department started making some marking on the
portions of the land purchased by the plaintiff, stating that a
substantial portion of the land purchased by the plaintiff in
Survey No.60/1 and 61 belonged to the Defence Department
and treated as B-4 in their records. Plaintiff then preferred an
application dated 12.09.1983 to the District Collector under the
A.P. Survey and Boundaries Act for demarcation of boundaries.
Following that, Deputy Director of Survey issued a notice dated
21.01.1984 calling upon the plaintiff and 3rd Defendant to
attend to the demarcation on 25.01.1984. Later, a joint survey
was conducted. The 3rd Defendant stated that land to the extent
of 4 acres and 35 guntas in Survey No.60 and 61 corresponds
to their G.L.R. (General Land Register) No.445 and it is their
land as per the record. The Deputy Director of Survey, however,
stated that lands in Survey Nos.60 and 61 of Kakaguda village
are patta lands as per the settlement records and vacant,
abutting Tirumalagiri village boundaries to Military Pillers and
not partly covered in Survey No.60. Plaintiff later filed an
application for issuing of a certificate as per the plan prepared
by the Revenue Records under Section 19(v) of the Urban Land
Ceiling Act. Plaintiff further stated that pending that application,
officers of Garrison Engineers, on the direction of the 3rd
Defendant, illegally occupied land measuring 2 acres and 29
guntas in Survey No.60 and 4 acres and 01 guntas in Survey
No.61. Thus, a total extent of land 6 acres and 30 guntas was
encroached upon and construction was effected despite the
protest by the plaintiff. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff
preferred the present suit, the details of which have already
been stated earlier.
5. The 3rd Defendant filed a written statement stating that
an area of land measuring 7 acres and 51 guntas, out of Survey
No.1, 60 and 61 of Kakaguda village comprising G.L.R. Survey
No.445 of Cantonment belongs to the first Defendant, which is
locally managed and possessed by Defendant No.3 being local
representative of Defendant No.1 and D-3 and is also the
custodian of all defence records. Further, it was also stated that,
as per the G.L.R., the said land was classified as B-4 and
placed under the management of Defence Estates Officer. It
was also stated that the suit land is part of review Survey
Nos.60 and 61 and the plaintiff is wrongly claiming that the said
land was purchased by it. Further, it was also stated that the
plaintiff is threatening to encroach upon another 6 guntas of land
alleged to be situated in Survey Nos.60/1 and 61. It has been
categorically stated that, as per the records maintained by the
3rd Defendant, land measuring 7 acres and 51 guntas, forming
part of G.L.R. Survey No.445 of the Cantonment is part of
Survey Nos.1, 60 and 61 of Kakaguda village. It is owned,
possessed and enjoyed by Defendant Nos.1 to 4 and 7.
6. The plaintiff, in order to establish its claim, examined
PWs 1 to 4 and produced Exs. A-1 to A-85 and Exs. X-1 to X-
10 besides Exs. A-86 to A-89 on behalf of DW1. On behalf of
the defendants DW1 was examined and Exs D-1 to D-7 are
produced.
7. The primary issue which came up for consideration
before the trial court was whether the plaintiff has got ownership
and possession over 6 acres and 30 guntas covered by Survey
No.60/1 and 61 of Kakaguda village for which considerable
reliance was placed on the settlement record (Setwar Ex.A-3
of 1353 Fasli). On the other hand, the defendants placed
considerable reliance on G.L.R. Survey No.445 of the
Cantonment which is part of Survey No.1, 60 and 61 of
Kakaguda village, wherein, according to the defendants, the suit
land falls. PW2, the Deputy Inspector of Survey stated,
according to Setwar, land in Survey Nos.60, 61 and 62 is patta
land of Prakash Reddy and others and such Survey numbers
corresponds to Old Survey No.53. The evidence of PW-3 and

4 also states that the land is covered by old Survey No.53 which
figures in Survey Nos.60, 61 and 62. Ext. A-3 Setwar, is a
settlement register prepared by the Survey Officer at the time
of revised survey and settlement in the year 1358 Fasli in which
the names of the predecessors in title of the plaintiff are shown
as pattedars. In other words, Ex-A-3 is the exhibit of rights and
title of plaintiff™s predecessors in title.
8. Defedants, as already indicated, on the other hand,
pleaded that the total extent of Survey No.53 was only 33
acres and 12 guntas and if that be so, after sub-division the
extent of sub-divided survey numbers would also remain the
same, but the extent of sub-divided Survey Nos.60, 61 and 62
were increased to 41 acres and 32 guntas in the revenue
records without any notice to the defendants which according
to the defendants, was fraudulently done by one Venkata
Narasimha Reddy, the original land owner of Survey No.53 of
Kakaguda village, who himself was the Patwari of Kakaguda
village. Further, it was the stand of the Defendants that in
exercise of powers under The Secunderabad and Aurangabad
Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1930, the G.LR. of
1933 was prepared by Captain O.M. James after making
detailed enquiries from the holder of occupancy rights as well
as general public. Further, it is also stated that certain land
within the villages were handed over by the then Nizam to
British Government for military use. Land in question measuring
7 acres and 51 guntas in G.L.R. 1933 at Survey No.581 was
used by the British Government as murram pits and it was
classified as Class-C land vested in the Cantonment Authority.
G.L.R. 1933 was re-written in the year 1956 in view of the
provisions of Rule 3 of Cantonment Land Administration Rules,
1937 and said Survey No.581 was re-written as G.L.R. Survey
No.445. Further, in view of the classification of the land, as
stipulated in Cantonment Land Administration rules, 1937, land
pertaining to G.L.R. Survey No.445 was re-classified as B-4
(vacant land) reserved for future military purposes and
management was transferred from cantonment authority to
Defence Estate.
9. The above-mentioned facts would indicate that the
plaintiff traces their title to the various sale deeds, Ext.A-3
Setwar of 1353 Fasli and the oral evidence of the survey
officials and the defendants claim title and possession of the
land on the basis of the G.L.R. The question that falls for
consideration is whether the evidence adduced by the plaintiff
is sufficient to establish the title to the land in question and to
give a declaration of title and possession by the civil court.
10. Shri Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel appearing
for the appellants submitted that G.L.R. 445 measuring an area
of 7 acres and 51 guntas is classified as B-4 and placed under
the management of the Defence Estate Officer. Column 7 of
the G.L.R. would indicate that the landlord is the Central
Government. Out of 7 acres and 51 guntas, land admeasuring
6 acres has been handed over to Defence Accounts
Department for construction of Defence Staff Quarters as per
survey No.445/A, as per the records as early as in 1984.
Further, it was pointed out that the appellant had already
constructed approximately 300 quarters in 6 acres of land.
Learned senior counsel submitted that since the extent of land
mentioned in old Survey No.53 as well as in the settlement and
partition deed, do not tally to the extent of land mentioned in
Ext.A-3 and burden is heavy on the side of the plaintiff to show
and explain as to how the registered family settlement and
partition deed did not take place in the disputed land. Learned
senior counsel also submitted that the High Court has
committed an error in ignoring the G.L.R. produced by the
defendants, even though there is no burden on the defendants
to establish its title in a suit filed by the plaintiff for declaration
of title and possession.

once the evidence is let in by both the parties, the question of
burden of proof pales into insignificance and the evidence let
in by both the parties is required to be appreciated by the court
in order to record its findings in respect of each of the issues
that may ultimately determine the fate of the suit. The High Court
has also proceeded on the basis that initial burden would
always be upon the plaintiff to establish its case but if the
evidence let in by defendants in support of their case
probabalises the case set up by the plaintiff, such evidence
cannot be ignored and kept out of consideration.
14. At the outset, let us examine the legal position with
regard to whom the burden of proof lies in a suit for declaration
of title and possession. This Court in 
Maran Mar Basselios
Catholicos v. Thukalan Paulo Avira
 reported in AIR 1959 SC
31 observed that ﬁin a suit for declaration if the plaintiffs are to
succeed, they must do so on the strength of their own title.ﬂ In
Nagar Palika, Jind v. Jagat Singh, Advocate
 (1995) 3 SCC
426, this Court held as under:
ﬁthe onus to prove title to the property in question was on
the plaintiff. In a suit for ejectment based on title it was
incumbent on the part of the court of appeal first to record
a finding on the claim of title to the suit land made on behalf
of the plaintiff. The court is bound to enquire or investigate
that question first before going into any other question that
may arise in a suit.ﬂ
15. The legal position, therefore, is clear that the plaintiff
in a suit for declaration of title and possession could succeed
only on the strength of its own title and that could be done only
by adducing sufficient evidence to discharge the onus on it,
irrespective of the question whether the defendants have proved
their case or not. We are of the view that even if the title set up
by the defendants is found against, in the absence of
establishment of plaintiff™s own title, plaintiff must be non-suited.
16. We notice that the trial court as well as the High Court
respondents submitted that the city civil court as well as the
High Court have correctly appreciated and understood the legal
position and correctly discarded the entries made in the G.L.R.
Learned senior counsel submitted that the correctness and
evidentiary value of G.L.R. entries have to be appreciated in
the context of the history of the Secunderabad Cantonment.
Reference was made to the provisions of Cantonment Act,
1924 and it was pointed out that the Secunderabad and
Aurangabad Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1930 do
not apply to the Kakaguda village. Learned senior counsel have
also referred to Ex.A6, the Sesala Pahani for the year 1955-
58, of Kakaguda village, Ex.A7, the Pahani Patrika for the year
1971-72, Ex.A8, the Pahani Patrika for the year 1972-73 and
submitted that they would indicate that Methurama Reddy, the
predecessor in title, was the Pattedar of Survey Nos.60 and
61 of Kakaguda village. It was pointed out that the entries made
therein have evidentiary value. Learned counsel pointed out that
the Settlement Register prepared under the Statutes and
Pahanies maintained under the Hyderabad Record of Rights
in Land Regulations of 1358, Fasli have considerable
evidentiary value. Further, it was also pointed out that the land
in question is pot kharab land, which is not normally treated as
land in Section 3(j) of Ceiling Act and hance may not figure in
a Settlement or Partition Deed, hence not subjected to any
revenue assessment. Learned senior counsel submitted that
the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing its title to the property
in question, as was found by the city civil court as well as the
High Court which calls for no interference by this Court under
Article 136 of the Constitution.
12. It is trite law that, in a suit for declaration of title, burden
always lies on the plaintiff to make out and establish a clear
case for granting such a declaration and the weakness, if any,
of the case set up by the defendants would not be a ground to
grant relief to the plaintiff.
13. The High Court, we notice, has taken the view that

rather than examining that question in depth, as to whether the
plaintiffs have succeeded in establishing their title on the
scheduled suit land, went on to examine in depth the weakness
of the defendants title. Defendants relied on the entries in the
GLR and their possession or re-possession over the suit land
to non-suit the Plaintiffs. The court went on to examine the
correctness and evidentiary value of the entries in the GLR in
the context of the history and scope of Cantonment Act, 1924,
the Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1925 and tried to
establish that no reliance could be placed on the GLR. The
question is not whether the GLR could be accepted or not, the
question is, whether the plaintiff could prove its title over the suit
property in question. The entries in the GLR by themselves may
not constitute title, but the question is whether entries made in
Ext.A-3 would confer title or not on the Plaintiff.
17. This Court in several Judgments has held that the
revenue records does not confer title. In 
Corporation of the City
of Bangalore v. M. Papaiah and Another 
(1989) 3 SCC 612
held that ﬁit is firmly established that revenue records are not
documents of title, and the question of interpretation of
document not being a document of title is not a question of law.ﬂ
In 
Guru Amarjit Singh v. Rattan Chand and Others
 (1993) 4
SCC 349 this Court has held that ﬁthat the entries in jamabandi
are not proof of titleﬂ. In 
State of Himachal Pradesh
 
v. Keshav
Ram and Others
 (1996) 11 SCC 257 this Court held that ﬁthe
entries in the revenue papers, by no stretch of imagination can
form the basis for declaration of title in favour of the plaintiff.ﬂ
18. The Plaintiff has also maintained the stand that their
predecessor-in-interest was the Pattadar of the suit land. In a
given case, the conferment of Patta as such does not confer
title. Reference may be made to the judgment of this Court in
Syndicate Bank v. Estate Officer & Manager, APIIC Ltd. &
Ors. 
(2007) 8 SCC 361 and 
Vatticherukuru Village Panchayat
v. Nori Venkatarama Deekshithulu & Ors. 
(1991) Supp. (2)
SCC 228.
19. We notice that the above principle laid down by this
Court sought to be distinguished by the High Court on the
ground that none of the above-mentioned judgments, there is
any reference to any statutory provisions under which revenue
records referred therein, namely, revenue register, settlement
register, jamabandi registers are maintained. The High Court
took the view that Ext.A-3 has evidentiary value since the same
has been prepared on the basis of Hyderabad record of Rights
in Land Regulation, 1358 Fasli. It was also noticed that column
1 to 19 of Pahani Patrika is nothing but record of rights and
the entries in column 1 to 19 in Pahani Patrika shall be deemed
to be entries made and maintained under Regulations.
20. We are of the view that even if the entries in the
Record of Rights carry evidentiary value, that itself would not
confer any title on the plaintiff on the suit land in question. Ext.X-
1 is Classer Register of 1347 which according to the trial court,
speaks of the ownership of the plaintiff™s vendor™s property. We
are of the view that these entries, as such, would not confer any
title. Plaintiffs have to show, independent of those entries, that
the plaintiff™s predecessors had title over the property in
question and it is that property which they have purchased. The
only document that has been produced before the court was
the registered family settlement and partition deed dated
11.12.1939 of their predecessor in interest, wherein, admittedly,
the suit land in question has not been mentioned.
21. Learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents
submitted that the land in question is pot kharab and since no
tax is being paid, the same would not normally be mentioned
in the partition deed or settlement deed. The A.P. Survey and
Settlement Mannual, Chapter XIII deals with pot kharab land,
which is generally a non-cultivable land and if the predecessors
in interest had ownership over this pot kharab land, the suit
land, we fail to see, why there is no reference at all to the family
settlement and partition deed dated 11.12.1939. Admittedly,
the predecessor in interest of the plaintiff got this property in

question through the above-mentioned family settlement and
partition deed. Conspicuous absence of the suit land in
question in the above-mentioned deed would cast doubt about
the ownership and title of the plaintiffs over the suit land in
question. No acceptable explanation has been given by the
plaintiff to explain away the conspicuous omission of the suit
land in the registered family settlement and partition deed.
Facts would also clearly indicate that in Ext-A1, the suit land
has been described in old Survey No.53 which was allotted to
the plaintiff™s predecessors in title. It is the common case of the
parties that Survey No.53 was sub-divided into Survey Nos.60,
61 and 63. Admittedly, the old Survey No.53 takes in only 33
acres and 12 guntas, then naturally, Survey Nos.60, 61 and 63
cannot be more than that extent. Further, if pot kharab land is
not recorded in the revenue record, it would be so even in case
of sub-division of Old Survey No. 53. The only explanation was
that, since the suit land being pot kharab land, it might not have
been mentioned in Ex.A.
22. A family settlement is based generally on the
assumption that there was an antecedent title of some kind in
the purchase and the arrangement acknowledges and defines
what that title was. In a family settlement-cum-partition, the
parties may define the shares in the joint property and may
either choose to divide the property by metes and bounds or
may continue to live together and enjoy the property as
common. So far as this case is concerned, Ex.A1 is totally
silent as to whose share the suit land will fall and who will enjoy
it. Needless to say that the burden is on the plaintiff to explain
away those factors, but the plaintiff has not succeeded. On other
hand, much emphasis has been placed on the failure on the
part of the defendants to show that the applicability of the GLR.
The defendant maintained the stand that the entries made in
GLR, maintained under the Cantonment Land Administration
Rules, 1937, in the regular course of administration of the
cantonment lands, are admissible in evidence and the entries
made therein will prevail over the records maintained under the
various enactment, like the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area)
Land Revenue Act, 1317 Falsi, the Hyderabad Record of
Rights in Land Regulation, 1358 Falsi, the Hyderabad Record
of Rights Rules, 1956 etc. In order to establish that position,
reliance was placed on the judgments of this Court in

SCC 315. Both, the trial Court and the High Court made a
detailed exercise to find out whether the GLR Register
maintained under the Cantonment Land Administration Rules,
1937 and the entries made there under will have more
evidentiary value than the Revenue records made by the
Survey Department of the State Government. In our view, such
an exercise was totally unnecessary. Rather than finding out the
weakness of GLR, the Courts ought to have examined the
soundness of the plaintiff case. We reiterate that the plaintiff
has to succeed only on the strength of his case and not on the
weakness of the case set up by the defendants in a suit for
declaration of title and possession.
23. In such circumstances, we are of the view that the
plaintiff has not succeeded in establishing his title and
possession of the suit land in question. The appeal is,
therefore, allowed and the judgment of the trial court, affirmed
by the High Court, is set aside. However, there will be no order
as to costs.
R.P.
Appeal allowed.

ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE:
Faulty investigation and deficient prosecution --
Directions given to State Governments to examine all orders
of acquittal and record reasons for the failure of each
prosecution case -- A standing committee of senior officers
of the police and prosecution departments should be vested
with this responsibility -- Home Department of every State
Government will incorporate in its existing training
programmes for investigation/prosecution officials course-
content drawn in light of instant judgment.
Respondent no.1 was prosecuted for committing
offences punishable u/ss 363, 369, 376, 394, 302 and 201,
IPC and s. 135(1) of Bombay Police Act, on the
allegations that he abducted a six year old girl, raped and
killed her. It was also alleged that the accused chopped
off her feet just above ankles and took away her anklets.
The trial court convicted and sentenced the accused to
death. However, the High Court noticing several missing
links in the chain of circumstances, allowed his appeal
and acquitted him giving him benefit of doubt.
Dismissing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 
1.1. Since the guilt of the accused in the
instant case is to be based on circumstantial evidence,
establishing of a complete chain from the evidence
produced by the prosecution becomes essential. The
serious lapses committed by the investigating and
prosecuting agencies and the deficiencies during the
course of investigation and prosecution, in the instant
case, are as follows:
(a) According to the prosecution story after having
removed the anklets from victim™s feet, the accused
had taken them to a Jeweller™s shop and pledged
them for a sum of Rs. 1,000/-. The jeweller had gone
to the police station with the anklets on his own, after
having read the news. The lapse of the prosecution
on account of not producing the jeweller as
prosecution witness, resulted in a missing link in the
chain of events. [para 11(a)] [221-B-D, E-F, G-H]
(b) The prosecution story discloses that the jeweller
had executed a receipt with the accused, who put his
thumb mark thereon, depicting the pledging of the
anklets for a sum of Rs.1,000/-. The prosecution took
no steps to compare the thumb impression on the
receipt, with that of the accused-respondent.
[para
11(b)] [222-B-C, C-D, E-F]
(c) It is also the case of the prosecution, that when
the accused was apprehended, a sum of Rs.940/-
was recovered from his possession. However, he
ought to have been in possession of at least Rs.1,000/
- i.e., the amount given to him by the jeweller when
he pledged the anklets at his shop, even if it is
assumed that he had no money with him when he
had pawned the anklets. [para 11(c)] [223-C-D]
(d) In order to prove the prosecution case that the
victim was raped, the doctor, who had medically
examined the accused and had been cited as a
witness before the trial court, was not examined as
a prosecution witness. [para 11(d)] [223-G-H]
(e) Even the report/certificate given by the medical
officer relating to the medical examination of the
accused was not produced by the prosecution
before the trial court. His evidence could have
established, whether or not accused had committed
rape on victim. [para 11(e)] [224-A-C]
(f) The accused could have been medically examined
within a period of 24 hours of the occurrence. The

prosecution case does not show whether or not
such action was taken. [para 11(f)] [224-E-F]
(g) When the accused was arrested, there were
several injuries on his person. He was sent to Civil
Hospital for his medical examination. Neither the
doctor who had examined him was produced as a
prosecution witness, nor was the report/certificate
given by the medical officer disclosing the details of
his observations/findings was placed on record. The
importance of nature of the injuries suffered by the
accused emerges from the fact, that both the
accused and the victim had the same blood group
ﬁB +veﬂ. The investigating agency ought to have
sought DNA profiling of the blood samples, which
would have given a clear picture whether or not the
blood of the victim was, in fact on the clothes of the
accused-respondent. Additionally, DNA profiling of
the blood found on the knife used in the commission
of the crime, would have uncontrovertibly
determined whether or not the said knife had been
used for severing the legs of the victim, to remove
her anklets. [11(g)] [225-B, D-E, G; 226-F-H]
(h) It is also apparent from the complaint submitted
by PW 2, that he had been informed by one ‚KG™, that
he had seen the accused taking away the victim. In
such an event, the proof of the fact of the accused
having abducted the victim and her last seen with
accused could have only been substantiated through
the statement of ‚KG™. [para 11(h)] [227-B-C]
(i) A green blood stained ﬁdupattaﬂ was recovered
from the person of the victim, which neither belonged
to the victim nor to the accused. The presence of the
green ﬁdupattaﬂ, has also not been explained. [para
11(i)] [227-F-H]
(j) PW6 is said to have seen the accused-respondent
for the first time when the latter approached his ﬁlariﬂ
to purchase a ﬁdabeliﬂ on 27.2.2003. Therefore, it was
imperative for the investigating agency to hold a test
identification parade in order to determine whether
PW6, had correctly identified the accused-respondent,
as the person who had come to his ﬁlariﬂ to purchase
a ﬁdabeliﬂ on 27.2.2003 and also whether he was the
same person, who had stolen a knife from his ﬁlariﬂ
on 27.2.2003. [para 11(j)] [228-C-D]
(k) All the prosecution witnesses have been equivocal
about the fact that the deceased went missing at
about 6:00 p.m., i.e., the time when she was last seen
in the company of the accused, and thereafter the
search party met the accused at 8:00 pm. Within the
period of these two hours the accused is alleged to
have visited different places and committed several
acts. However, no sketch map indicating the distance
between different places was prepared, which would
have helped the court to determine all that was
alleged in the prosecution version of the incident.
[para 11(k)] [229-C-D; 230-F-G, H; 231-A]
1.2. Discrepancies found in the evidence produced
by the prosecution before the trial court are as follows:
(a) The post mortem report states that injuries on the
genitals of deceased were post mortem in nature. It
is not possible to contemplate that the legs of the
deceased were cut whilst she was in her senses. It
does not appear humanly possible for even the most
perverted person, to have committed rape on a child,
who had been killed by causing injuries on head and
other parts of body, and after her feet had been
severed from her legs. The prosecution in the instant
case apparently projected a version including an act
of rape, which is impossible to accept on the

touchstone of logic and common sense. [para 12(a)]
[231-B, F-H; 232-A]
(b) The evidence produced by the prosecution also
reveals that pubic hair of the accused had been
examined in the Forensic Science Laboratory. The
FSL report does not support the prosecution case of
rape by the accused. This would prima facie
exculpate him from the offence of rape. [para 12(b)]
[232-B and D]
(c) According to the testimony of the complainant
PW2, the accused was wearing a white shirt at the
time of occurrence. It is, therefore, when a white shirt
was found covering the dead body of the victim, he
had identified the same as the shirt which the
accused was wearing, before the offence was
committed. From the prosecution story, as it emerged
from the statements of different witnesses, it is
apparent that PW2 had had no occasion to have seen
the accused, wearing the said white shirt. [para 12(c)]
[232-E-G]
(d) The T-shirt worn by accused at the time of his
arrest was a white one, but PW-2 in his complaint has
mentioned that the accused was wearing a black T-
shirt at the time of his detention. Thus, narration in
this regard made by the complainant PW2 was
absolutely incorrect and contrary to the factual
position and, as such, his deposition does not
appear to be fair and honest. [para 12(d)] [233-B-D]
(e) From the statements of PW2 and PW5, it is
apparent that the accused was detained by the police
informally around 9:00 p.m. on 27.2.2003. However,
his arrest was shown at 6.40 a.m. on 28.3.2003. The
detention of the accused from 9:00 pm on 27.2.2003
to 6.40 a.m. on 28.2.2003, shows that the prosecution
has not presented the case in the manner the events
unfolded to the investigating agencies. [para 12(e)]
[233-G-H; 234-B-C]
(f) The inquest panchnama besides mentioning the
amputation of the legs of the victim above her
ankles, also records that the silver anklets worn by
the victim were missing. In this behalf, it would also
be relevant to mention, that even though the inquest
panchnama was drawn at 00.30 a.m. on 28.2.2003, the
complaint resulting in the registration of the first
information report was lodged by PW2 at 3:05 a.m.
on 28.02.2003. It is strange, that the inquest
panchnama should be drawn before the registration
of the first information report. It is also strange as to
how, while drawing the inquest panchnama, the
panchas of the same could have recorded that after
amputation of the victim™s legs, her silver anklets had
been taken away by the offender, as there was no
occasion for the panchas to have known, that the
deceased used to wear silver anklets. [para 12(f)]
[234-C-F]
(g) From the prosecution version (emerging from the
evidence recorded before the trial court), it is
apparent, that the search party as also the relatives
of the victim were aware at about 8:00 p.m. on
27.2.2003 that she had been murdered, with a
possibility of her having been raped also, and her
silver anklets had been stolen. Still no complaint
whatsoever came to be filed on 27.2.2003, despite the
close coordination between the search party and the
police from 8:00 pm onwards on 27.2.2003 itself. The
complaint leading to the filing of the first information
was made at about 3:05 a.m. on 28.2.2003. Not only
is the delay of seven hours in the registration of the
complaint un-explained, but the same is also
rendered extremely suspicious, on account of the fact

that the accused is acknowledged to be in police
detention since 9:00 p.m. on 27.2.2003 itself. This may
be the result of fudging the time and date on which
the victim went missing, as also, the time and date
on which the body of the victim was discovered
resulting in the discovery of the occurrence itself.
[para 12(g)] [234-G-H; 235-B-D]
(h) PW13, the Sub Inspector, who had commenced
investigation of the crime, acknowledged about
informal detention of accused at about 9 P.M. on
27.2.2003. But, in his statement as a witness, he had
expressed that for the first time he had seen the
accused only on 28.2.2003 at around 5:30 a.m.
Whereafter, the accused-respondent was formally
arrested at 6.40 a.m. The inconsistency between the
statements made by the complainant (PW2) and his
father (PW5) on the one hand, and by Sub-Inspector
(PW13) on the other, discloses a serious
contradiction with respect to the time of detention of
the accused. The truth of the matter is that PW 13 did
not make any note either in the station diary or in any
other register; he did not take any informal complaint
from the complainant, even though he had been
apprised about the commission of the offence. It is
therefore, clear that PW13, had left the police station
without making an entry depicting the purpose of his
departure. A police officer, investigating a crime of
such a heinous nature should not commit such a
lapse. All this further adds to the suspicion of the
manner in which investigation of the matter was
conducted. [para 12(h)] [235-E-H; 236-B-F]
(i) PW6 could identify the shirt worn by the accused-
respondent, when he visited his ﬁlariﬂ for a very short
period during rush hours for the purchase of a
ﬁdabeliﬂ, but he could not depose about the sort of
shirt which the accused was wearing at the Police
Station where he remained with the accused for
approximately four hours. It is, therefore, apparent
that PW6 was deposing far in excess of what he
remembered, and/or in excess of what was actually
to his knowledge. He appears to be a tutored
witness. This aspect of the matter also renders the
testimony of PW6, suspicious. [para 12(i)] [236-G-H;
237-B and E-F]
(j) The investigating agency became aware from the
disclosure statement of the accused tendered on
1.3.2003, that he had procured the weapon of offence
by way of theft from the ﬁlariﬂ of PW6. In the ordinary
course of investigation, it would have been
imperative for the investigating agency to have
immediately approached PW6, to record his
statement, but his statement was recorded for the
first time on 4.3.2003. No reason is forthcoming why
his statement was not recorded either on 1.3.2003, or
on the intervening dates before 4.3.2003. The
inordinate delay by the investigating agency, in
confirming the version of the accused, in respect of
the weapon of the crime, renders the prosecution
version suspicious. Such delay would not have
taken place in the ordinary course of investigation.
This fact too raises a doubt about the correctness of
the prosecution version of the incident. [para 12(j)]
[237-G-H; 238-B-D]
1.3. The prosecution case which mainly rests on the
testimony of PW2, PW5 and PW6, is unreliable because
of the glairing inconsistencies in their statements. The
testimony of the investigating officer PW13 shows
fudging and padding, making his deposition
untrustworthy. In the absence of direct oral evidence, the
prosecution case almost wholly rested on these
witnesses. The evidence produced to prove the charges
has been systematically shattered, thereby demolishing

the prosecution version. More than all that is the non-
production of evidence which the prosecution has
unjustifiably withheld, resulting in dashing all the State
efforts to the ground. Therefore, the High Court through
the impugned order, rightly considered it just and
appropriate to grant the accused-respondent, the benefit
of doubt. [para 12] [238-F-H; 239-A]
1.4. Having considered the totality of the facts and
circumstances of the case, specially the glaring lapses
committed in the investigation and prosecution of the
case as also the inconsistencies in the evidence
produced by the prosecution, this Court is of the
considered view that judgment of acquittal passed by the
High Court needs no interference. [para 14] [242-G-H; 243-

2.1. The investigating officials and the prosecutors
involved in presenting the instant case, have miserably
failed in discharging their duties. They have been
instrumental in denying to serve the cause of justice. The
misery of the family of the victim has remained
unredressed. At the same time, it is necessary not to
overlook even the hardship suffered by the accused, first
during the trial of the case, and then at the appellate
stages. An innocent person does not deserve to suffer
the turmoil of a long drawn litigation, spanning over a
decade, or more. [para 15 and 17] [243-G; 245-B]
2.2. Just like it is the bounden duty of a court to
serve the cause of justice to the victim, so also, it is the
bounden duty of a court to ensure that an innocent
person is not subjected to the rigours of criminal
prosecution. The situation needs to be remedied. For the
said purpose, adherence to a simple procedure could
serve the objective. It is, therefore, directed that on the
completion of the investigation in a criminal case, the
prosecuting agency should apply its independent mind,
and ensure that all shortcomings are rectified, if
necessary by requiring further investigation. It should
also be ensured, that the evidence gathered during
investigation is truly and faithfully utilized, by confirming
that all relevant witnesses and materials for proving the
charges are conscientiously presented during the trial of
a case. This would achieve two purposes Œ (1) only
persons against whom there is sufficient evidence, will
have to suffer the rigors of criminal prosecution; and (2)
in most criminal prosecutions, the agencies concerned
will be able to successfully establish the guilt of the
accused. [para 18 and 19] [246-B-C and D-F]
2.3. Every acquittal should be understood as a failure
of the justice delivery system, in serving the cause of
justice. Likewise, every acquittal should ordinarily lead to
the inference, that an innocent person was wrongfully
prosecuted. It is therefore, essential that every State
should put in place a procedural mechanism, which

would ensure that the cause of justice is served, and
would simultaneously ensure the safeguard of interest of
those who are innocent. It is, therefore, directed:
(i) The Home Department of every State shall
examine all orders of acquittal and record reasons
for the failure of each prosecution case. A standing
committee of senior officers of the police and
prosecution departments should be vested with this
responsibility. The consideration at the hands of
such committee should be utilized for crystalizing
mistakes committed during investigation, and/or
prosecution, or both. The Home Department of every
State Government will incorporate in its existing
training programmes for junior investigation/
prosecution officials course-content drawn in the
light of the instant judgment. The same should also
constitute course-content of refresher training
programmes, for senior investigating/prosecuting
officials. Judgments like the one in hand (depicting
more than 10 glaring lapses in the investigation/
prosecution of the case), and similar other
judgments, may also be added to the training
programmes. [para 20] [246-G-H; 247-A-C]
(ii) On the culmination of a criminal case in acquittal,
the investigating/prosecuting official(s) concerned
responsible for such acquittal must necessarily be
identified. A finding needs to be recorded in each
case, whether the lapse was innocent or
blameworthy. [para 21] [247-G-H]
(iii) The Home Department of every State Government
shall formulate a procedure for taking action against
all erring investigating/prosecuting officials/officers.
All such erring officials/officers identified, as
responsible for failure of a prosecution case, on
account of sheer negligence or because of culpable
lapses, must suffer departmental action. All the Home
Secretaries concerned shall ensure compliance. The
records of consideration, in compliance with the
direction, shall be maintained. [para 21-22] [248-C
and E-F]
(iv) The Home Department of the State will identify
the erring officers in the instant case, and will take
appropriate departmental action against them, as
may be considered appropriate, in accordance with
law. [para 23] [248-F-G]

Vibha Dutta Makhija, Archi Agnihotri, Hemantika Wahi for
the Appellant.
Rishi Malhotra for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.
 1. A complaint was
lodged at Navrangpura Police Station, Ahmedabad, alleging
the kidnapping/abduction of a six year old girl child Gomi
daughter of Keshabhai Mathabhai Solanki and Laliben on
27.2.2003 at around 6:00 p.m. by the accused Kishanbhai son
of Velabhai Vanabhai Marwadi. It was alleged, that the
accused had enticed Gomi with a ﬁgolaﬂ (crushed ice, with
sweet flavoured syrup), and thereupon had taken her to Jivi™s
field, where he raped her. He had murdered her by inflicting
injuries on her head and other parts of the body with bricks. In
order to steal the ﬁjhanjrisﬂ (anklets) worn by her, he had
chopped off her feet just above her ankles. The aforesaid
complaint was lodged, after the body of the deceased Gomi
was found from Jivi™s field, at the instance of the accused
Kishanbhai. On the receipt of the above complaint, the first
information report came to be registered at Navrangpur Police
Station, Ahmedabad.
2. The prosecution version which emerged consequent
upon the completion of the investigation reveals, that the family
of the deceased Gomi was distantly related to the family of the
accused Kishanbhai. In this behalf it would be pertinent to
mention that Baghabhai Naranbhai Solanki was a resident of
Gulbai Tekra, in the Navrangpura area of Ahmedabad. He
resided there, along with his family. For his livelihood,
Baghabhai Naranbhai Solanki was running a shop in the name
of Mahakali Pan Centre. The said shop was located near his
residence. Baghabhai Naranbhai Solanki was running the
business of selling ﬁpan and bidiﬂ in his shop. Naranbhai
Manabhai Solanki, father of Baghabhai Naranbhai Solanki
used to live in the peon™s quarters at Ambavadi in Ahmedabad.
Modabhai Manabhai Solanki, uncle of Baghabhai Naranbhai
Solanki, had expired. His son Devabhai™s daughter Laliben,
was married to Keshabhai Mathabhai Solanki. Keshabhai
Mathabhai Solanki and Laliben were residing at
Shabamukhiwas, Gulbai Tekra in Ahmedabad. Keshabhai
Mathabhai Solanki and Laliben had two children, a daughter
Gomi aged six years, and a son Himat aged three years.
Laliben™s sister-in-law (her husband™s, elder brother™s wife)
Fuliben Valabhai was residing near the residence of Keshabhai
Mathabhai Solanki and Laliben. Kishanbhai the accused, is the
brother of Fuliben, and was residing with her. It is therefore, that
the family of the deceased as also the accused, besides being
distantly related, were acquainted with one another as they were
residing close to one another.
3. Insofar as the occurrence is concerned, according to the
prosecution, on 27.2.2003 Laliben, niece of Baghabhai, was
confined to her residence, as she was expecting. At about 6:00
p.m. her daughter Gomi, then aged 6 years, had wandered out
of her house. The accused Kishanbhai then aged 19 years,
entice her by giving her a ﬁgolaﬂ. Having enticed her he had
carried Gomi to Jivi™s field. On the way to Jivi™s field, he stole
a knife with an 8 inch blade from Dineshbhai Karsanbhai
Thakore PW6,
 
a ﬁdabeliﬂ (bread/bun, with spiced potato filling)
seller. Having taken Gomi to Jivi™s field he had raped her. He
had then killed her by causing injuries on her head and other
parts of the body with bricks. In order to remove the ﬁjhanjrisﬂ
worn by her, he had amputated her legs with the knife stolen
by him, from just above her ankles. He had then covered her
body with his shirt, and had left Jivi™s field. Kishanbhai the
accused, then took the anklets stolen by him to Mahavir
Jewellers, a shop owned by Premchand Shankerlal. He
pledged the anklets at the above shop, for a sum of Rs.1,000/

. KISHANBHAI
[JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]
-. The accused Kishanbhai was confronted by Baghabhai and
others constituting the search party, whilst he was on his way
back to his residence. Kishanbhai, despite stating that he had
not taken her away, had informed those searching for Gomi,
that she could be at Jivi™s field. On the suggestion of
Kishanbhai, the search party had gone to Jivi™s farm, where
they found the body of Gomi.
4. Based on the aforesaid fact situation, confirmed through
the investigation carried on by the Police, a charge-sheet was
framed against the accused Kishanbhai under Sections 363,
369, 376, 394, 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code, and
Section 135(1) of the Bombay Police Act. The above charge-
sheet was filed before the Metropolitan Magistrate,
Ahmedabad. Since the offences involved could be tried only
by a Court of Session, the Metropolitan Magistrate, committed
the matter to the Court of Session. On 8.3.2004, the Sessions
Court to which the matter came to be assigned, for trial, framed
charges. Since the accused Kishanbhai denied his involvement
in the matter, the court permitted the prosecution to lead
evidence.
5. The prosecution examined 14 witnesses. The statement
of the accused Kishanbhai was thereafter recorded under
Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In his above
statement, the accused Kishanbhai denied his involvement.
Even though an opportunity was afforded to Kishanbhai, he did
not lead any evidence in his defence. After examining the
evidence produced by the prosecution, the Trial Court vide its
judgment dated 18.8.2004, arrived at the conclusion that
prosecution had successfully proved its case beyond
reasonable doubt. By a separate order dated 18.8.2004 the
Trial Court sentenced Kishanbhai to death by hanging, subject
to confirmation of the said sentence by the High Court of
Gujarat at Ahmedabad (hereinafter referred to as the ‚High
Court™) under Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
6. In the above view of the matter, the proceedings
conducted by the Court of Session, were placed before the
High Court at the behest of the State of Gujarat, as
Confirmation Case No. 7 of 2004. Independently of the
confirmation proceedings, the accused Kishanbhai, aggrieved
by the judgment and order of sentence dated 18.8.2004, in
Sessions Case No. 346 of 2003, filed Criminal Appeal No.
1549 of 2004 before the High Court.
7. The criminal appeal filed by the accused Kishanbhai
was accepted by the High Court. Kishanbhai was acquitted by
giving him the benefit of doubt. The Confirmation Case No. 7
of 2004 was turned down in view of the judgment of acquittal
rendered by the High Court while allowing Criminal Appeal no.
1549 of 2004.
8. Dissatisfied with the order passed by the High Court,
the State of Gujarat approached this Court by filing Petition for
Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No. 599 of 2006. On 11.9.2008
leave to appeal was granted. Thereupon, the matter came to
be registered as Criminal Appeal No. 1485 of 2008.
9. Before this Court, learned counsel for the appellant, in
order to substantiate the guilt of the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai, has tried to project that the prosecution was
successful in demonstrating an unbroken chain of
circumstances, clearly establishing the culpability of the
accused. In fact, the endeavour at the hands of the learned
counsel for the appellant was to project an unbroken chain of
circumstances to establish the guilt of the accused. Despite the
defects in investigation and the prosecution of the case, as
also, the inconsistencies highlighted by the High Court in the
evidence produced by the prosecution, learned counsel for the
State expressed confidence, to establish the guilt of the
accused-respondent. In this behalf, it is essential to record the
various heads under which submissions were advanced at the
hands of the learned counsel for the appellant-State. We shall,
therefore, briefly summarise all the contentions, and while doing
so, refer to the evidence brought to our notice by the learned

[JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]
counsel for the appellant, to establish the guilt of the accused-
respondent, Kishanbhai. The submissions advanced before us
are accordingly being recorded hereunder :
(a) First and foremost, learned counsel for the appellant,
in order to connect the accused with the crime under reference,
extensively relied upon the evidence produced by the
prosecution to show that the accused-respondent Kishanbhai
was last seen with the victim. He was seen taking away the
victim Gomi. For the above, reliance was placed on the
statement of Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5, who had
deposed that he had seen the deceased Gomi with the
accused-respondent Kishanbhai on 27.2.2003 at around 6:00
p.m. As per his deposition, he had seen Gomi eating a ﬁgolaﬂ
outside his (the witness™s) residence. At the same juncture, he
had also seen the accused-respondent Kishanbhai coming
from the side of Polytechnic. Kishanbhai, according to the
deposition of PW5, had approached Gomi. Thereafter, as per
the statement of PW5, the accused had carried away Gomi
towards the side of the Polytechnic. In his testimony, Naranbhai
Manabhai Solanki PW5, had also stated, that at about 9:00 pm,
when he had again seen the accused-respondent Kishanbhai
coming from the road leading to the Gulbai Tekra Police
Chowki, he was asked, by those who were searching for Gomi,
about her whereabouts. The accused was also asked about the
whereabouts of Gomi, by Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5
and by the son of PW 5 i.e., by Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki
PW2. To the aforesaid queries, according to Naranbhai
Manabhai Solanki PW5, the accused-respondent Kishanbhai
had stated, that she might be sitting in Jivi™s field. In addition
to the testimony of Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5,
reference was also made to the testimony of Dinesh
Karshanbhai Thakore PW6. PW6, during his deposition, had
asserted, that the accused-respondent Kishanbhai had come
to his ﬁlariﬂ (handcart used by hawkers, to sell their products)
for purchasing a ﬁdabeliﬂ. It was pointed out by Dinesh
Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, that he had noticed the accused
carrying a child aged about seven years, wearing a red frock.
In his statement, he also affirmed that the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai, had asked him for a knife but he had declined to
give it to him. Thereupon, whilst leaving his ﬁlariﬂ, Kishanbhai
had stolen a knife from his ﬁlariﬂ. It was also pointed out, that
the knife recovered at the instance of the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai, was identified by him as the one stolen from his
ﬁlariﬂ. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, the last
seen evidence referred to above stands duly corroborated by
the deposition of Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2, not only
in his deposition before the Trial Court, but also in the complaint
filed by him at the first instance at Navrangpur Police Station,
Ahmedabad, immediately after the recovery of the dead body
of Gomi from Jivi™s field.
(b) Learned counsel for the appellant also laid emphasis
on the recovery of the weapon of offence, i.e., a blood stained
knife, at the instance of none other than the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai himself. In order to substantiate the instant aspect
of the matter, learned counsel placed reliance on the testimony
of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, who deposed that the
accused had visited his ﬁlariﬂ on the evening of 27.2.2003 for
the purchase of a ﬁdabeliﬂ. The accused respondent, as noticed
earlier, as per the statement of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore
PW6, was carrying a small girl aged about 7 years. He also
deposed, that the accused-respondent had asked him for his
knife, but upon his refusal, had stolen the same from his ﬁlariﬂ.
Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, had identified the knife
which had been recovered at the instance of the accused, as
the one stolen by the accused-respondent Kishanbhai from his
ﬁlariﬂ. Additionally it was submitted, that the accused had led
the police to Jivi™s field, from where he got recovered the murder
weapon, i.e., the same knife which he had stolen from the ﬁlariﬂ
of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6. The above knife had a
blade measuring eight inches, including a steel handle of four
inches. At the time of recovery of the knife, the same had stains
of blood. The above knife was recovered by the police on

. KISHANBHAI
[JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]
1.3.2003, in the presence of an independent witness, namely,
Rameshbhai Lakhabhai Bhati PW1, who in his deposition
clearly narrated, that the knife in question was recovered from
Jivi™s field, from under some stones at the instance of the
accused-respondent Kishanbhai.
(c) Learned counsel for the appellant, then referred to the
medical evidence produced by the prosecution, so as to
contend that the wounds inflicted on the person of Gomi, were
with the murder weapon, i.e., the knife recovered at the instance
of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai. For this, learned
counsel placed reliance on the statement of Dr. Saumil
Premchandbhai Merchant PW8, who had conducted the post-
mortem examination of the deceased Gomi on 28.2.2003. In
the post-mortem report, according to learned counsel, mention
was made about several incised injuries which could have been
inflicted with the knife stolen by the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai. In this respect, reference was made to serial No.14
of the post-mortem notes (Exhibit 29) proved by Dr. Saumil
Premchandbhai Merchant PW8, clearly indicating, that the
injuries caused to the victim which have been referred to at
serial No.7, could have been caused with the knife (muddamal
Article No.19), i.e., the same knife, which had been recovered
at the instance of the accused. Even in the inquest panchnama
(Exhibit 14), it was recorded that both legs of the victim Gomi
were mutated from just above the ankle with a sharp weapon,
with the object of removing the anklets in the feet of the victim
Gomi. This document, according to the learned counsel, also
indicates the use of a knife in the occurrence under reference.
(d) It was also the submission of the learned counsel for
the appellant, that at the time of recovery of the body of the
victim from Jivi™s field, the same was found to be covered with
a shirt with stripes. It was submitted, that the aforesaid shirt was
identified as the shirt worn by the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai, when he was seen carrying away the victim Gomi,
on 27.2.2003. In this behalf, reliance was placed by the learned
counsel for the appellant, on the testimony of Naranbhai
Manabhai Solanki PW5. The above witnesses had identified
the shirt as a white shirt with lines. To give credence to the
testimony of Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5, learned
counsel also pointed out, that when the accused was found
coming from the direction of the police station after the
commission of the crime, he was seen wearing a black T-shirt.
The statement of Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5, was
sought to be corroborated with the statement of Dinesh
Karshanbhai Thakore PW6. The accused respondent is stated
to have approached the ﬁlariﬂ of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore
PW6 for purchasing a ﬁdabeliﬂ, and at that juncture, the
accused-respondent is stated to have been wearing a white
lined shirt, and a green trouser. On the recovery of the shirt and
trouser, they were marked as Mudammal Articles 8 and 14
respectively. Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6 had identified
the shirt, as also, the trouser during the course of his deposition
before the Trial Court. The green trouser worn by the accused-
respondent was also identified by Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki
PW2. Additionally, Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2 deposed
that a black colour T-shirt was worn by the accused-respondent
when he was apprehended and brought to the police station.
The above articles were also identified by Angha Lalabhai
Marwadi PW12 and Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai PW13 who were
the panch witnesses at the time of seizure of the
abovementioned clothing.
(e) It was also the submission of the learned counsel for
the appellant, that the report of the forensic science laboratory
was sufficient to confirm, that the accused respondent was the
one who was involved in the commission of the crime under
reference. In this behalf, it was pointed out that the victim Gomi
was shown to have blood group ﬁB+veﬂ. According to the report
of the Forensic Science Laboratory, the bricks recovered from
the place of occurrence (which had been used in causing
injuries on the head and other body parts of the victim), the
panties worn by the deceased victim Gomi, the white shirt

which was found on the body of the victim at the time of its
recovery from Jivi™s field, the T-shirt and the green trouser worn
by the accused respondent Kishanbhai (at the time he was
apprehended), and even the weapon of the crime, namely, the
knife recovered at the instance of the accused-respondent, were
all found with blood stains. The forensic report reveals that the
blood stains on all the above articles were of blood group
ﬁB+veﬂ. It was, therefore, the submission of the learned counsel
for the appellant, that the accused-respondent was
unmistakably shown to be connected with the crime under
reference.
(f) In order to substantiate the motive of the accused-
respondent, learned counsel for the appellant relied upon the
statement of the investigating officer Ranchhodji Bhojrajji
Chauhan PW14, who had stated in his deposition that the
owner of Mahavir Jewellers, i.e., Premchand Shankarlal Mehta
had presented himself at the police station. The
abovementioned jeweler is stated to have informed the police,
that the accused respondent Kishanbhai had pawned the
anklets belonging to the victim Gomi with him for a sum of
Rs.1,000/-. Insofar as the identification of the anklets is
concerned, reference was made to the statement of Keshobhai
Madanbhai Solanki PW7, i.e., father of the victim who had
identified the anklets marked as Muddamal Article No.18, as
belonging to his daughter Gomi, which she was wearing when
she had gone missing. Reference was also made to the
statement of Jagdishbhai Bhagabhai Marwadi PW11, as also,
the panchnama of recovery of the silver anklets which also,
according to learned counsel, connects the accused to the
crime.
(g) Last but not the least, learned counsel for the appellant
invited this Court™s attention to the statement tendered by the
accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
During the course of his above testimony, he was confronted
with the evidence of the relevant witnesses depicting, that the
victim Gomi was last seen in his company at 6:00 p.m. on
27.2.2003. He was also confronted with the fact, that he himself
had informed the search party, that Gomi may be found at Jivi™s
field. It is submitted, that the accused-respondent Kishanbhai,
who had special knowledge about the whereabouts of the
deceased, was bound to explain and prove when and where
he had parted from the company of the victim Gomi. It was
submitted that during the course of his deposition under
Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the accused
could not tender any satisfactory explanation.
Based on the above evidence, it was the submission of
the learned counsel for the appellant, that even in the absence
of any eye witness account, the prosecution should be held to
have been successful in establishing the guilt of the accused-
respondent Kishanbhai through circumstantial evidence. The
claim of circumstantial evidence emerging from different
witnesses summarized above, according to the learned
counsel, leads to one and only one conclusion, namely, that the
accused-respondent Kishanbhai alone had committed the
criminal acts under reference. It was submitted, that the chain
of circumstantial evidence, was sufficient to establish, that none
other than the accused-respondent could have committed the
alleged criminal actions. It was also contended, that no link in
the chain of circumstantial evidence was missing, so as to
render any ambiguity in the matter.
10. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties.
To determine the controversy arising out of the instant criminal
appeal, we shall first endeavour to summarise the conclusions
drawn by the High Court under different heads. We have
decided to adopt the above procedure to understand the
implications of various aspects of the evidence produced by
the prosecution before the Trial Court. This procedure has been
adopted by us (even though the same was neither adopted by
the Trial Court, or by the High Court) so as to effectively
understand, and thereupon, to adequately deal with the

[JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]
contentions advanced at the hands of the appellant, before this
Court.
11. We would first of all, like to deal with the lapses
committed by the investigating and prosecuting agencies in the
process of establishing the guilt of the accused before the Trial
Court. It will be relevant to mention that all these lacunae/
deficiencies, during the course of investigation and prosecution,
were pointed out by the High Court, in the impugned judgment.
These constitute relevant aspects, which are liable to be taken
into consideration while examining the evidence relied upon by
the prosecution. We have summarised the aforesaid lapses,
pointedly to enable us to correctly deal with the submissions
advanced at the behest of the State. Since the guilt of the
accused in the instant case is to be based on circumstantial
evidence, it is essential for us to determine whether or not a
complete chain of events stand established from the evidence
produced by the prosecution. The above deficiencies and
shortcomings are being summarised below:
(a) According to the prosecution story after having removed
the anklets from Gomi™s feet, the accused Kishanbai had taken
the anklets to Mahavir Jewellers, a shop owned by Premchand
Shankerlal. He pledged aforesaid anklets with Premchand
Shankerlal, for a sum of Rs. 1,000/-. The anklets under
reference, were handed over by Premchand Shankerlal to the
investing officer on 1.3.2003, in the presence of two panch
witnesses. According to the prosecution case, the jeweller had
gone to the police station with the anklets on his own, after
having read newspaper reports to the effect, that a girl had
been raped and murdered and her anklets had been taken
away. He had approached the police station under the
suspicion, that the anklets pledged with him, might have
belonged to the girl mentioned in the newspaper reports. One
of the panch witnesses, namely, Jagdishbhai Marwari PW15
had deposed, that above Premchand Shankerlal had identified
the accused Kishanbhai, as the very person who had pledged
the anklets with him. In this behalf it is relevant to mention, that
Premchand Shankerlal was not produced as a prosecution
witness. It is important to notice, that the anklets handed over
to the Police, were successfully established by the prosecution
as the ones worn by the deceased Gomi. The lapse of the
prosecution on account of not producing Premchand Shankerlal
as prosecution witness, according to the High Court, resulted
in a missing link in the chain of events which would have
established the link of the accused Kishanbhai, with the anklets,
and thereby convulsively connecting him with the crime.
(b) The prosecution story further discloses, that Premchand
Shankerlal the owner of Mahavir Jewellers, had executed a
receipt with the accused Kishanbhai, depicting the pledging of
the anklets for a sum of Rs.1,000/-. The aforesaid receipt was
placed on record of the Trial Court as exhibit 52. The above
receipt according to Premchand Shankerlal, was thumb
marked by the accused Kishanbhai. Even though the receipt
indicates the name of the person who had pledged the anklets
as Rajubhai, the same could clearly be a false name given by
the person who pledged the anklets. Certainly, there could be
no mistake in the identity of the thumb mark affixed on the said
receipt. The prosecution could have easily established the
identity of the pledger, by comparing the thumb impression on
the receipt (exhibit 52), with the thumb impression of the
accused-respondent Kishanbhai. This was however not done.
The lapse committed by the prosecution in not producing
Premchand Shankerlal as a witness, could have easily been
overcome by proving the identity of the person who had pledged
the anklets, by identifying the thumb impression on the receipt
(exhibit 52), in accordance with law. In case the thumb
impression turned out to be that of the accused Kishanbhai, he
would be unmistakably linked with the crime. In case it was
found not to be the thumb impression of the accused
Kishanbhai, his innocence could also have been inferred.
According to the High Court this important lapse in proving the

. KISHANBHAI
[JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]
prosecution case before the Trial Court, had resulted in a major
obstacle in establishing the guilt/innocence of the accused.
(c) It is also the case of the prosecution, that when the
accused Kishanbhai was apprehended, a sum of Rs.940/- was
recovered from his possession. According to the prosecution
story the accused Kishanbhai had pledged the anklets at
Mahavir Jewellers with Premchand Shankerlal for a sum of Rs.
1,000/-. In order to link the money recovered from his
possession at the time of his detention, it was imperative for
the prosecution to establish how and why a sum of Rs.940/-
only, was recovered from the possession of the accused
Kishanbhai. He ought to have been in possession of at least
Rs.1,000/- i.e., the amount given to him by Premchand
Shankerlal when he pledged the anklets at his shop, even if it
is assumed that he had no money with him when he had
pawned the anklets. This important link having not been
established by the prosecution, breaks the chain of events
necessary to establish the guilt of the accused Kishanbhai, and
constitutes a serious lapse in the prosecution evidence.
(d) It is apparent from the prosecution story, that the victim
Gomi was raped. In establishing the factum of the rape the
prosecution had relied upon the note prepared at the time of
conducting the post-mortem examination of the deceased
Gomi. The same inter alia reveals, that dry blood was present
over the labia, and deep laceration of subcutaneous tissues was
present on the left margin of the vaginal opening, just above
the posterior commission. The hymen was also found ruptured
at 3 and 6,O™ clock. It is therefore, that the accused was deputed
for being subjected to medical examination, during the course
of investigation. For the above purpose he was examined by
Dr. P.D. Shah. In fact Dr. P.D. Shah was a cited witness before
the Trial Court. Despite the above Dr. P.D. Shah was not
examined as a prosecution witness. Clearly a vital link in a chain
of events, to establish the rape of the victim Gomi came to be
broken consequent upon by the non-examination of Dr. P.D.
Shah as a prosecution witness.
(e) The High Court has also noticed, that even the report/
certificate given by the medical officer relating to the medical
examination of the accused Kishanbhai was not produced by
the prosecution before the Trial Court. It is apparent, that the
lapse in not producing Dr. P.D. Shah as a prosecution witness,
may have been overcome if the report prepared by him (after
examining the accused Kishanbhai) was placed on the record
of the Trial Court, after being proved in accordance with law.
The action of prosecution in not producing the aforesaid report
before the Trial Court, was another serious lapse in proving the
case before the Trial Court. This had also resulted a missing
vital link, in the chain of events which could have established,
whether or not accused Kishanbhai had committed rape on
victim Gomi.
(f) The High Court having noticed the injuries suffered by
Gomi, a six year old girl child on her genitals, had expressed
the view, that the same would have resulted in reciprocal injuries
to the male organ of the person who had committed rape on
her. It was pointed out, that if the accused Kishanbhai had been
sent for medical examination the testimony or the report of the
medical officer would have revealed the presence of smegma
around the corona-glandis, which would have either established
innocence or guilt of the accused, specially if the accused had
been medically examined within 24 hours. In the instant case
the sequence of the events reveal, that the occurrence had been
committed between 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. on 27.2.2003. At

resulted the omission of a vital link in the chain of events which
would have unquestionably established the guilt of the accused
Kishanbhai of having committed rape (or possibly his
innocence).
(g) It needs to be noticed, that when the accused
Kishanbhai was arrested, there were several injuries on his
person. The said injuries were also depicted in his arrest
panchnama. At 7:15 am on 28.2.2003, the accused Kishanbhai
filed a first information report alleging, that he was beaten by
some of the relatives of the victim Gomi, as also, by some
unknown persons accompanying the search party, under the
suspicion/belief, that he was responsible for the occurrence. In
the above first information report, the accused Kishanbhai had
also depicted the nature of injuries suffered by him. The
statement of the investigating officer Ranchodji Bhojrajji
Chauhan PW14 reveals, that the accused Kishanbhai had been
sent to Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, for his medical examination.
Neither the doctor who had examined the accused was
produced as a prosecution witness, nor the report/certificate
given by the medical officer disclosing the details of his
observations/findings was placed on record. This evidence was
vital for the success of the prosecution case. According to the
High Court, blood of group ﬁB +veﬂ was found on the clothes of
the accused Kishanbhai. The important question to be
determined thereupon was, whether it was his own blood or
blood of the victim Gomi. The statement of the medical officer
who had examined the accused Kishabhai, when he was sent
for medical examination to Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, would
have disclose whether or not accused Kishanbhai had any
bleeding injuries. The importance of nature of the injuries
suffered by the accused Kishanbhai emerges from the fact, that
both the accused Kishanbhai and the victim Gomi had the
same blood group ﬁB +veﬂ. An inference could have only been
drawn that the blood on his clothes was that of the victim, in
case it was established that the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai had not suffered any bleeding injuries, and
therefore, the possibility of his own blood being on his clothes
was ruled out. This important link in the chain of events is also
missing from the evidence produced by the prosecution, and
constitutes a serious lapse in the investigation/prosecution of
the case.
In view of the above factual position, the High Court made
the following observations ﬁLooking to the advancement in the
field of medical science, the investigating agency should not
have stopped at this stage. Though ABO system of blood
grouping is one of the most important system, which is being
normally used for distinguishing blood of different persons, there
are about 19 genetically determined blood grouping systems
known to the present day science, and it is also known that there
are about 200 different blood groups, which have been identified
by the modern scientific methods (Source: Mc-Graw-Hill
Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, Vol.2). Had such an
effort been made by the prosecution, the outcome of the said
effort would have helped a lot to the trial Court in ascertaining
whether the accused had in fact visited the scene of offence.ﬂ
This also constitutes a glaring lapse in the investigation of the
crime under reference.
There has now been a great advancement in scientific
investigation on the instant aspect of the matter. The
investigating agency ought to have sought DNA profiling of the
blood samples, which would have given a clear picture whether
or not the blood of the victim Gomi was, in fact on the clothes
of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai. This scientific
investigation would have unquestionably determined whether or
not the accused-respondent was linked with the crime.
Additionally, DNA profiling of the blood found on the knife used
in the commission of the crime (which the accused-respondent,
Kishanbhai had allegedly stolen from Dinesh Karshanbhai
Thakore PW6), would have uncontrovertibly determined,
whether or not the said knife had been used for severing the
legs of the victim Gomi, to remove her anklets. In spite of so

much advancement in the field of forensic science, the
investigating agency seriously erred in carrying out an effective
investigation to genuinely determine the culpability of the
accused-respondent Kishanbhai.
(h) It is also apparent from the complaint submitted by
Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW 2, that he had been informed
by one Kalabhai Ganeshbhai, that he had seen the accused
Kishanbhai taking away Gomi. In such an event, the proof of
the fact of the accused-respondent having abducted Gomi could
have only been substantiated, through the statement of
Kalabhai Ganeshbhai
 
who had allegedly actually seen the
accused Kishanbhai taking her away. According to the High
Court, for the reasons best known to it, the prosecution did not
produce Kalabhai Ganeshbhai
 
as a witness. Even though
according to the High Court the above-mentioned Kalabhai
Ganeshbhai was a resident in one of the peon quarters, and
was also a government servant, the absence of the evidence
of the above factual position, results in a deficiency in the
confirmation of a factual position of substantial importance,
from the chain of events necessary for establishing the last seen
evidence.
(i) It is also apparent, that there is no dispute about the
recovery of a green blood stained ﬁdupattaﬂ, from the person
of the victim. The green blood stained ﬁdupattaﬂ (veil) was found
by the medical officer while conducting the post-mortem
examination on Gomi. The existence of the green ﬁdupattaﬂ was
also duly mentioned in the post-mortem report. According to
the High Court, none of the prosecution witnesses had referred
to the factum of the victim having worn a green ﬁdupattaﬂ.
According to the prosecution evidence, the deceased was
wearing a red frock and panties, whereas, the accused was
wearing a full sleeve white shirt and green trousers. According
to the High Court, if neither the victim nor the accused had a
green ﬁdupattaﬂ, a question would arise, as to how the green
blood stained ﬁdupattaﬂ was found on the dead body of the
victim. Even leading to the inference of the presence of a third
party at the time of occurrence. The above omission in not
explaining the presence of the green ﬁdupattaﬂ, has also been
taken by the High Court, as a glaring omission at the hands of
the prosecution in the process of investigation/prosecution of
the charges levelled against the accused Kishanbhai.
(j) While deposing before the Trial Court, Dinesh
Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, affirmed that the accused-
respondent Kishanbhai had approached his ﬁlariﬂ for the first
time to purchase a ﬁdabeliﬂ on 27.2.2003. It is, therefore,
apparent that Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6 had not known
the accused-respondent before 27.2.2003. In the above view
of the matter, it was imperative for the investigating agency to
hold a test identification parade in order to determine whether
Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, had correctly identified the
accused-respondent, as the person who had come to his ﬁlariﬂ
to purchase a ﬁdabeliﬂ on 27.2.2003. And also whether he was
the same person, who had stolen a knife from his ﬁlariﬂ on
27.2.2003. This is also a serious deficiency in the investigation/
prosecution of the case.
(k) Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2, the complainant in
the present case, during the course of his examination-in-chief,
observed as under :
ﬁThis incident was occurred on 27/2/2003, on that day
Lilaben came to my house for pregnancy. On the day of
the incident at 6.00 o clock in the evening I came to know
that Gomiben the daughter of Lilaben is not found.
Therefore, all our relatives have started searching her. We
went to the quarter of my father, and inquired about the
Gomiben, my father told that I saw Gomiben with Lalis
Sister in law brother Kisan, he gave ice cream to Gomi.
Therefore, we have searched in the quarters and other
places. At around 8.00 o clock in the night kishan was
coming from police Station, we have started asking him,

Mohanbhai Molabhai, Hirabhai were present. This police
Chawky means Gulbai Tekra Police Chawky. He told me
that I have left her at Jivivala Field. Therefore, we went at
the Jivivala Field, at around 8.00 or 9.00 o clock, we went
there and we found Gomiben in dead conditions, she had
a several injuries on her head and other parts of the body.
She was being raped.ﬂ
From the above statement, it is apparent that Gomi was
found missing for the first time at 6:00 pm. The search for her
began immediately thereafter. The search party met the
accused-respondent Kishanbhai coming from the side of the
police station at 8:00 p.m. All the prosecution witnesses have
been equivocal about the fact that Gomi went missing at about
6:00 p.m., i.e., the time when she was last seen in the company
of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai, and thereafter, the
search party met Kishanbhai at 8:00 pm. In order to give
credence to the prosecution version, it was imperative to
establish that it was possible for the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai, after having taken Gomi at 6:00 p.m., to have
stopped at the ﬁlariﬂ of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6,
purchased a ﬁdabeliﬂ from him. Thereupon, to have had time
to steal his knife, the accused-respondent proceeded on with
Gomi to Jivi™s field. There ought to have been enough time for
him thereafter to have raped her, then assaulted her with bricks
on her head and other parts of the body leading to her death,
and finally to cut her legs just above her ankles, to remove her
anklets. He should thereupon have also had time to hide the
knife used in the commission of the crime, under the stones.
And thereafter further time, to have taken the anklets to Mahavir
Jewellers so as to pawn the same with Premchand Shankarlal
Mehta, as also, time to execute a receipt in token thereof. Over
and above the above, he ought have had time, to visit his
residence so as to able to wear a fresh shirt i.e., the shirt which
he was wearing when he was detained. After all that, he should
have had time to cover the area from Jivi™s field to Premchand
Shankarlal Mehta™s shop and further on from the above shop
to his residence and finally from his residence till the place
where he was detained. It is difficult to appreciate how all the
activities depicted in the prosecution story, could have been
carried out from 6:00 p.m. on 27.2.2003 to 8:00 p.m. on the
same day, i.e., all in all within a period of two hours. It is in the
above context that the cross-examination of Naranbhai
Manabhai Solanki PW5, assume significance. Relevant extract
from his cross-examination is being reproduced hereunder :
ﬁIt is true that the accused was coming from police Chawky
at around 8.00 or 8.30 p.m. as I was not wearing the watch
I cannot say the exact time. It is true that it takes 
15 to 20
minutes to go to Panjrapole from my quarters
, and 
it will
take 30 to 35 minutes to go to the field of JIVI
. It is true
that 
it will taken half an hour to come to the Office of BSNL
through Jivi™s Field and C.N. Vidhayalaya. 
It is true that
from the Jivis field towards Panjrapole and through
Panjrapole main road towards BSNL office, by walking it
will take 40 minutes
. It is true that both the roads are public
roads, and many people are passing through this road.ﬂ
(emphasis is ours)
Whether or not the above sequence of events could have
taken place in the time referred to above, would have been
easily overcome if the prosecution had placed on record a
sketch map providing details with regard to the distance
between different places. In that event, it would have become
possible to determine whether the activities at different places,
projected through the prosecution version of the incident were
possible. In the absence of any knowledge about the distance
between the residence of the victim Gomi as well as that of the
accused from the Polytechnic or from Jivi™s field; it would be
impossible to ascertain the questions which emerge from the
cross-examination of Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5. Had
a sketch map been prepared or details with regard to the
distance been given, the courts concerned would have been
able to determine all that was alleged in the prosecution version

of the incident. This deficiency in the prosecution evidence,
must be construed as a serious infirmity in the matter.
12. We would now like to deal with the discrepancies found
in the evidence produced by the prosecution before the Trial
Court. We would also simultaneously summarise the effect of
defences adopted on behalf of the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai. These aspects of the matter are also being
summerised hereunder, so as to enable us to effectively deal
with the submissions advanced at the behest of the State.
These aspects of the matter are liable to be taken into
consideration, to determine whether or not, a complete chain
of events stands proved to establish the guilt of the accused-
respondent. The above considerations are summarized
hereunder:
(a) The post mortem report relied upon by the prosecution
leaves no room for any doubt that injuries on the genitals of
Gomi were post mortem in nature. The question which arises
for consideration is whether the injuries under reference had
been inflicted on the victim first, and thereupon, rape was
committed on the victim. It is natural to assume, that the first
act of aggression by the person who had committed assault
on Gomi, was by inflicting injuries on her head and other parts
of the body, only thereafter the legs just above the ankles,
would have been cut (with the object of removing her anklets).
It is not possible for us to contemplate that the legs of the
deceased were cut whilst she was in her senses, is
incomprehensible and therefore, most unlikely. Now, the
question to be considered is, whether it was humanly possible
for even the most perverted person, to have committed rape
on a child, who had been killed by causing injuries on head and
other parts of body, and after her feet had been severed from
her legs. We would have no hesitation by responding in the
negative. The prosecution in the instant case apparently
projected a version including an act of rape, which is
impossible to accept on the touchstone of logic and common
sense.
(b) The evidence produced by the prosecution also
reveals, that pubic hair of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai,
had been examined by the scientific officer of the Forensic
Science Laboratory. The report submitted by the Forensic
Science Laboratory (Exhibit 48) reveals, that there was neither
any semen nor any blood on the pubic hair of the accused.
Reference to the possibility of there being blood on the public
hair of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai emerges from the
fact, that the post mortem report of the deceased revealed, that
there was blood on the vagina of the deceased. Whilst accusing
the respondent-Kishanbhai of the offence under Section 376
of the Indian Penal Code, it was imperative for the prosecution
to have kept in its mind the aforesaid aspects of the matter.
Absence of semen or blood from the pubic hair of the accused-
respondent, would prima facie exculpate him from the offence
of rape.
(c)  According to the testimony of the complainant
Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2, the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai was wearing a white shirt at the time of occurrence.
It is, therefore, when a white shirt was found covering the dead
body of the victim Gomi, he had identified the same as the shirt
which the accused-respondent Kishanbhai was wearing, before
the offence was committed. From the prosecution story, as it
emerged from the statements of different witnesses, it is
apparent that Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2, had had no
occasion to have seen the accused-respondent Kishanbhai,
wearing the said white shirt. When Bababhai Naranbhai
Solanki PW2, was questioned as to how he knew that the
accused-respondent was wearing a white shirt, when he first
saw the shirt covering the dead body of the victim, his response
was, that he had been told about that by his father Naranbhai
Manabhai Solanki PW5. In the above view of the matter, the
question arises whether the testimony of Bababhai, Naranbhai

party, when the victim™s body was found on Jivi™s field. Even
before that, the accused-respondent was already in police
custody. As if, the police had already concluded on the guilt of
Kishanbhai, even before the recovery of Gomi™s body from Jivi™s
farm. Despite the above, the arrest of the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai was shown at 6.40 a.m. on 28.3.2003. The
detention of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai from 9:00 pm
on 27.2.2003 to 6.40 a.m. on 28.2.2003, shows that the
prosecution has not presented the case in the manner the
events unfolded to the investigating agencies.
(f) It also needs to be noticed, that the inquest panchnama
besides mentioning the amputation of the legs of the victim
above her ankles, also records, that the silver anklets worn by
Gomi were missing. In this behalf, it would also be relevant to
mention, that even though the inquest panchnama was drawn
at 0030 a.m. on 28.2.2003, the complaint resulting in the
registration of the first information report was lodged by
Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2 at 3:05 a.m. on 28.02.2003.
It is strange, that the inquest panchnama should be drawn
before the registration of the first information report. It is also
strange as to how, while drawing the inquest panchnama, the
panchas of the same could have recorded, that after
amputation of the victim™s legs, her silver anklets had been
taken away by the offender. There was no occasion for the
panchas to have known, that Gomi used to wear silver anklets.
Accordingly, there was no occasion for them to have recorded
that the silver anklets usually worn by Gomi had been taken away
by the offender.
(g) From the prosecution version (emerging from the
evidence recorded before the Trial Court), it is apparent, that
the search party, as also, the relatives of the victim were aware
at about 8:00 p.m. on 27.2.2003 that Gomi had been murdered,
with a possibility of her having been raped also, and her silver
anklets had been stolen. Despite the above, no complaint
whatsoever came to be filed in connection with the above
Solanki PW2 about the shirt referred to above was truthful. And
whether his testimony can be described as fair and honest.
(d) Additionally when the accusedŒrespondent Kishanbhai
was arrested, the T-shirt worn by him, was taken from him by
recording a panchnama. The said T-shirt is available on the
record of the Trial Court as Exhibit-39. It is not a matter of
dispute that the T-shirt (Exhibit 39), worn by the accused-
respondent, Kishanbhai at the time of his arrest, is actually a
white T-shirt with a trident design on it. But, as per the narration
recorded by Bababhai Naranbhai PW2, contained in the
complaint which constituted the basis of registering the first
information, it is mentioned that the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai was wearing a black T-shirt at the time of his
detention. It is apparent from the factual position noticed
hereinabove, that the factual position expressed by the
complainant Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2 was absolutely
incorrect, and contrary to the factual position. In the above view
of the matter, a question would arise, whether the deposition
of Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2 was fair and honest.
(e) According to the prosecution version of the incident,
the search party met the accused-respondent Kishanbhai at
about 8:00 p.m. The said party had thereupon proceeded to
Jivi™s field, from where the dead body of the victim was
recovered. According to Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5,
after finding the dead body, he had proceeded to the police
station. At the police station, he had requested the police
personnel to visit the site of occurrence. Simultaneously,
Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5 had stated, that when
enquiries were being made from Kishanbhai, police personnel
had taken away the accused-respondent. According to the
testimony of Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5, therefore, at
the most, the accused-respondent must be deemed to have
been taken into police custody from about 9:00 p.m. on
27.2.2003. It is apparent, that the occurrence had come to the
knowledge of a large number of persons constituting the search

occurrence at the police station on 27.2.2003, despite the close
coordination between the search party and the police from 8:00
pm onwards no 27.2.2003 itself. The complaint leading to the
filing of the first information was made at about 3:05 a.m. on
28.2.2003. Not only is the delay of seven hours in the
registration of the complaint ununderstandable, but the same
is also rendered extremely suspicious, on the account of the
fact that the accused-respondent Kishanbhai is acknowledged
to be in police detention since 9:00 p.m. on 27.2.2003 itself.
This may be the result of fudging the time and date at which
the victim Gomi went missing, as also, the time and date on
which the body of the victim was discovered resulting in the
discovery of the occurrence itself. The question which arises
for consideration is, whether the investigation agency adopted
the usual practice of padding so as to depict the occurrence
in a manner different from the actual occurrence. A question
also arises as to why it was necessary for the investigating
agency to adopt the above practice, despite the fact that it was
depicted as an open and shut case.
(h) As noticed above, that from the statements of Bababhai
Naranbhai Solanki PW2 and Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki
PW5, it is apparent that the accused was detained by the
police informally around 9:00 p.m. on 27.2.2003. It is also
essential to notice, that an acknowledgement was made to the
above effect even by Sub Inspector Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai
PW13, who had commenced investigation of the crime under
reference. It is apparent that when Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki
PW2, had contacted him with details about the offence under
reference, he had not recorded any entry in the station diary
before leaving the police station. This constitutes a serious
lapse in itself. In his cross-examination, he had affirmed that
he was taken by Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2, i.e., the
complainant to the scene of occurrence. Having gone to the
scene of occurrence, and having made on the spot investigation,
he acknowledged having returned to the police station. In his
statement, he accepted, that when he had returned to the police
station after visiting the site of occurrence, the accused-
respondent Kishanbhai was already present at the police
station. When questioned, he could not tender any explanation,
as to how the accused-respondent Kishanbhai had come to the
police station. In his statement as a witness, he had expressed,
that for the first time he had seen the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai only on 28.2.2003 at around 5:30 a.m. Whereafter,
the accused-respondent was formally arrested at 6.40 a.m. The
inconsistency between the statements made by the complainant
(Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2) and his father (Naranbhai
Manabhai Solanki PW5) on the one hand, and by Sub-Inspector
Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai PW13 on the other, discloses a
serious contradiction with respect to the time of the detention
of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai. It needs to be noticed,
that it was an aberration for Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai PW13,
to have left the police station without making an entry in the
station diary. Why should a police officer, investigating a crime
of such a heinous nature, commit such a lapse? The fact that
he did so, is not a matter of dispute. The truth of the matter is,
that Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai PW13, did not make any note
either in the station diary or in any other register; he did not take
any informal complaint from the complainant, even though he
had been apprised about the commission of an offence. It is
therefore clear that Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai PW13, had left
the police station without making an entry depicting the purpose
of his departure. All this further adds to the suspicion of the
manner in which investigation of the matter was conducted.
(i) So far as the statement of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore
PW6 is concerned, he had supported the prosecution story by
deposing, that the accused had visited his ﬁlariﬂ with a small
child, about seven years old. He had further asserted, that the
accused-respondent Kishanbhai had purchased a ﬁdabeliﬂ from
him. He had also testified that the accused Œrespondent had
asked for a knife but he had refused to give it to him because,
at the time when the accused-respondent had visited the ﬁlariﬂ,
there were several customers waiting for purchasing ﬁdabelisﬂ.

He further confirmed, that the accused-respondent had stolen
a knife, used by him for cutting vegetables from his ﬁlariﬂ.
Another important aspect of the matter, out of the statement of
Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6 is, that he identified the shirt
that the accused-respondent Kishanbhai was wearing, at the
time when he had visited his ﬁlariﬂ for purchasing a ﬁdabeliﬂ on
27.2.2003. He had also identified the red frock which the victim
was wearing at the said juncture. Additionally, he identified the
knife which the accused-respondent Kishanbhai had stolen
from his ﬁlariﬂ. The statement of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore
PW6 was considered to be untrustworthy by the High Court,
primarily for the reason that he could identify the shirt worn by
the accused-respondent, Kishanbhai when he had approached
his ﬁlariﬂ for the purchase of a ﬁdabeliﬂ, at which juncture, the
accused-respondent Kishanbhai may have remained at the
ﬁlariﬂ at the most for 10 to 15 minutes, when there was a rush
of customers. As against the above, he had remained with the
accused-respondent Kishanbhai at Navrangpur Police Station,
Ahmedabad, for approximately four hours. During the course
of his cross-examination, he could not depose about the sort
of shirt which the accused respondent was wearing, at the
Navrangpur Police Station, Ahmedabad. It is, therefore,
apparent that Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6 was deposing
far in excess of what he remembered, and/or in excess of what
was actually to his knowledge. He appears to be a tutored
witness. This aspect of the matter also renders the testimony
of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, suspicious.
(j) There is yet another aspect of the controversy relating
to Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6. The investigating agency
became aware from the disclosure statement of the accused-
respondent Kishanbhai tendered on 1.3.2003, that he had
procured the weapon of offence by way of theft from the ﬁlariﬂ
of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6. The above knife was
recovered at the instance of the accused-respondent
Kishanbhai on 1.3.2003, in the presence of panch witnesses.
In the above view of the matter, in the ordinary course of
investigation, it would have been imperative for the investigating
agency to have immediately approached Dinesh Karshanbhai
Thakore PW6, to record his statement. His statement was
extremely important for the simple reason, that it would have
connected the accused with the weapon with which the crime
had been committed, as also with the victim. Despite the
above, the investigating agency recorded the statement of
Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, for the first time on
4.3.2003. No reason is forthcoming why his statement was not
recorded either on 1.3.2003, or on the intervening dates before
4.3.2003. The inordinate delay by the investigating agency, in
confirming the version of the accused-respondent, in respect
of the weapon of the crime, renders the prosecution version
suspicious. Such delay would not have taken place in the
ordinary course of investigation. If there were good reasons for
the delay, they ought to have been made known to the Trial
Court by way of reliable evidence. This fact too raises a doubt
about the correctness of the prosecution version of the incident.
The above discrepancies in the prosecution version, were
duly noticed by the High Court. These constitute some of the
glaring instances recorded in the impugned order. Other
instances of contradiction were also noticed in the impugned
order. It is not necessary for us to record all of them, since the
above instances themselves are sufficient to draw some vitally
important inferences. Some of the inferences drawn from the
above, are being noticed below. The prosecution™s case which
mainly rests on the testimony of Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki
PW2, Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5 and Dinesh
Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, is unreliable because of the
glairing inconsistencies in their statements. The testimony of
the investigating officer Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai PW13 shows
fudging and padding, making his deposition untrustworthy. In
the absence of direct oral evidence, the prosecution case
almost wholly rested on the above mentioned witnesses. It is
for the above reasons, that the High Court through the

13. Learned counsel for the appellant, in order to support
the submissions advanced before this Court in the present
criminal appeal (which have been recorded in paragraph 9
hereinabove), with judicial precedent, placed reliance on a
number of judgments rendered by this Court. We shall now
summarise hereunder, the judgment relied upon, as also, the
submissions of the learned counsel on the basis thereof:
(a) Referring to the judgment rendered by this Court in 
Ram
Prasad & Ors. v. State of UP, 
(1974) 1 SCR 650, it was
asserted at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellant,
that non-examination of some of the eye-witnesses would not
introduce a fatal infirmity to the prosecution case, specially
when conviction could be based on evidence produced by the
prosecution.
(b) Reference was also made to 
Takhaji Hiraji v. Thakore
Kubersing Camansing & Ors., 
(2001) 6 SCC 145, and it was
pointed out, that this Court has ruled that in cases where
witnesses already examined were reliable, and the testimony
coming from the mouth was unimpeachable, a court could
safely act upon the same uninfluenced by the factum of non-
examination of other witnesses. Yet again the conclusion was,
that reliable evidence should be available, to determine the
culpability of an accused, and in the above view of the matter
it would be irrelevant whether some others who could have
deposed on the facts in issue had not been examined.
(c) Based on the judgment rendered in 
Laxman Naik v.
State of Orissa, 
(1994) 3 SCC 381, it was submitted, that in a
case relating to a seven year old child, who had been raped
and murdered by her own uncle, relying upon incriminating
evidence and testimony of witnesses, it came to be held that
when circumstances form a complete chain of incidents, then
the same is sufficient to establish, that the accused is the
perpetrator of the crime and conviction can be based on the
complete chain of circumstantial evidence.
(d) Based on the judgment in 
State of Maharashtra v.
Suresh, 
(2000) 1 SCC 471, where four years™ girl child was a
victim of rape and murder, it was contended, that this Court had
held that it was open to a court to presume that the accused
knew about the incriminating material or dead body due to his
involvement in the alleged offence. When he discloses the
location of such incriminating material without disclosing the
manner in which he came to know of the same, the Court would
presume that the accused knew about the incriminating
material.
(e) Relying on the judgment in 
Amar Singh v. Balwinder
Singh, 
2003 (2) SCC 518, it was contended, that where the
prosecution case is fully established by the testimony of
witnesses which stood corroborated by medical evidence, any
failure or omission of the investigating officer could not be
treated as sufficient to render the prosecution case doubtful or
unworthy of belief. This determination leads to the same
inference, namely, when reliable evidence to prove the guilt of
an accused is available, lapses in investigation would not result
in grant of the benefit of doubt to an accused.
(f) Referring to 
State Government of NCT Delhi v. Sunil,
(2001) 1 SCC 652, it was asserted, that in a case where a
child of four years was brutally raped and murdered and
incriminating articles were recovered on the basis of the
statement of the accused, the same could not be discarded on
the technical ground that no independent witness was examined.
(g) Referring to the judgment in 
Joseph v. State of Kerala,
(2005) 5 SCC 197, wherein, according to the learned counsel,
it was held that where the circumstances proved form
themselves into a complete chain unerringly pointing to the guilt
of the appellant, then the same can be the basis of the
conviction of the accused. This, according to learned counsel,

[JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]
represents the manner of proving the guilt of an accused based
on circumstantial evidence.
(h) Based on the judgment in 
State of UP v. Satish
 (2005)
3 SCC 114, it was contended that it could not be laid down as
a rule of universal application that if there is any delay in
examination of a particular witness, the prosecution version
becomes suspect. Therefore, the facts surrounding the delay
ought to be considered in every case to determine whether or
not the testimony is rendered suspicious.
(i) Relying on the judgment in 
Bishnu Prasad Sinha v State
of Assam, 
(2007) 11 SCC 467, it was submitted, that in the
above case where a child of 7-8 years was a victim of rape
and murder, the grounds that the investigation was done in an
improper manner did not render the entire prosecution case to
be false. Namely, where reliable evidence is available, the
same would determine the guilt of an accused.
(j) Referring to the judgment in 
Aftab Ahmad Anasari v.
State of Uttaranchal, 
(2010) 2 SCC 583, it was asserted, that
where a child of five years was a victim of rape and murder
and the accused disclosed the location of the crime as also of
the incriminating articles, the said disclosure was admissible
and would constitute a complete chain in the circumstances.
Further, according to the learned counsel, it was held that the
inquest panchnama may not contain every detail and the
absence of some details would not affect the veracity of the
deposition made by witnesses. Needless to mention, that
absence of vital links in the claim of circumstantial evidence
would result in the exoneration of the accused.
(
k) Reliance was placed on 
Sambhu Das v. State of
Assam,
 (2010) 10 SCC 374, so as to contend, that any
discrepancy occurring in the inquest report or the post mortem
report could neither be fatal nor be termed as a suspicious
circumstance as would warrant a benefit to the accused and
the resultant dismissal of the prosecution case. Needless to
add, that there should be sufficient independent evidence to
establish the guilt of the accused.
(l) Based on the judgment in 
Haresh Mohandas Rajput
v. State of Maharashtra,
 (2011) 12 SCC 56, it was contended,
that in a case of murder and rape of a ten year old child, it was
found that where the circumstances taken cumulatively led to
the conclusion of guilt and no alternative explanation is given
by the accused, the conviction ought to be upheld. This case
reiterates that in a case based on circumstantial evidence the
evidence should be such as would point to the inference of guilt
of the accused alone and none others.
(m) Relying on 
Rajendra PrahladraoWasnik v. State of
Maharashtra, 
(2012) 4 SCC 37, it was submitted that where a
three years old child was a victim of rape and murder by the
accused who lured her under the pretext of buying biscuits,
circumstances showed the manner in which the trust/belief/
relationship was violated resulting in affirming the death penalty
imposed on the accused.
14. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the
submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for
the appellant, which have been duly noticed in paragraph 9
hereinabove. It is also relevant for us to record, that the learned
counsel for the appellant did not advance a single submission
in addition to the contentions we have noticed in paragraph 9
above. The submissions advanced at the hands of the learned
counsel for the appellant, were sought to be supported by
judgments rendered by this Court, all of which have been
referred to in paragraph 13 above. The submissions advanced
at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellant, based on
each of the judgments cited, have also been recorded by us in
the said paragraph. Having considered the totality of the facts
and circumstances of this case, specially the glaring lapses
committed in the investigation and prosecution of the case
(recorded in paragraph 11 of the instant judgment), as also the
inconsistencies in the evidence produced by the prosecution

. KISHANBHAI
[JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]
(summarized in paragraph 12 hereinabove), we are of the
considered view, that each one of the submissions advanced
at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellant is
meritless. For the circumstantial evidence produced by the
prosecution, primary reliance has been placed on the
statements of Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2, Naranbhai
Manabhai Solanki PW5, and Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore
PW6. By demonstrating inconsistencies and infirmities in the
statements of the above witnesses, their statements have also
been rendered suspicious and accordingly unreliable. There is
also a serious impression of fudging and padding at the hands
of the agencies involved. As a matter of fact, the lack of
truthfulness of the statements of witnesses has been
demonstrated by means of simple logic emerging from the
factual position expressed through different prosecution
witnesses (summarized in paragraphs 11 and 12 above). The
evidence produced to prove the charges, has been
systematically shattered, thereby demolishing the prosecution
version. More than all that, is the non production of evidence
which the prosecution has unjustifiably withheld, resulting in
dashing all the States efforts to the ground. It is not necessary
for us to record our detailed determination on the submissions
advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellant,
for such reasons clearly emerge from the factual position
noticed in paragraphs 11 and 12 hereinabove. Recording of
reasons all over again, would just be a matter of repetition. In
view of the above, we find no merit in this appeal and the same
is accordingly dismissed.
15. The investigating officials and the prosecutors involved
in presenting this case, have miserably failed in discharging
their duties. They have been instrumental in denying to serve
the cause of justice. The misery of the family of the victim Gomi
has remained unredressed. The perpetrators of a horrendous
crime, involving extremely ruthless and savage treatment to the
victim, have remained unpunished. A heartless and merciless
criminal, who has committed an extremely heinous crime, has
gone scot-free. He must be walking around in Ahmedabad, or
some other city/town in India, with his head held high. A criminal
on the move. Fearless and fearsome. Fearless now, because
he could not be administered the punishment, he ought to have
suffered. And fearsome, on account of his having remained
unaffected by the brutal crime committed by him. His actions
now, know of no barriers. He could be expected to act in an
unfathomable savage manner, uncomprehendable to a sane
mind.
16. As we discharge our responsibility in deciding the
instant criminal appeal, we proceed to apply principles of law,
and draw inferences. For, that is our job. We are trained, not
to be swayed by mercy or compassion. We are trained to
adjudicate without taking sides, and without being mindful of
the consequences. We are required to adjudicate on the basis
of well drawn parameters. We have done all that. Despite
thereof, we feel crestfallen, heartbroken and sorrowful. We could
not serve the cause of justice, to an innocent child. We could
not even serve the cause of justice, to her immediate family.
The members of the family of Gomi must never have stopped
cursing themselves, for not adequately protecting their child
from a prowler, who had snatched an opportunity to brutalise
her, during their lapse in attentiveness. And if the prosecution
version about motive is correct, the crime was committed for
a mere consideration of Rs.1,000/-.
17. Every time there is an acquittal, the consequences are
just the same, as have been noticed hereinabove. The purpose
of justice has not been achieved. There is also another side to
be taken into consideration. We have declared the accused-
respondent innocent, by upholding the order of the High Court,
giving him the benefit of doubt. He may be truly innocent, or he
may have succeeded because of the lapses committed by the
investigating/prosecuting teams. If he has escaped, despite
being guilty, the investigating and the prosecution agencies
must be deemed to have seriously messed it all up. And if the

accused was wrongfully prosecuted, his suffering is
unfathomable. Here also, the investigating and prosecuting
agencies are blameworthy. It is therefore necessary, not to
overlook even the hardship suffered by the accused, first during
the trial of the case, and then at the appellate stages. An
innocent person does not deserve to suffer the turmoil of a long
drawn litigation, spanning over a decade, or more. The
expenses incurred by an accused in his defence can dry up all
his financial resources Œ ancestral or personal. Criminal litigation
could also ordinarily involve financial borrowings. An accused
can be expected to be under a financial debt, by the time his
ordeal is over.
18. Numerous petitions are filed before this Court, praying
for anticipatory bail (under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure) at the behest of persons apprehending arrest, or
for bail (under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure)
at the behest of persons already under detention. In a large
number of such petitions, the main contention is of false
implication. Likewise, many petitions seeking quashing of
criminal proceeding (filed under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure) come up for hearing day after day, wherein
also, the main contention is of fraudulent entanglement/
involvement. In matters where prayers for anticipatory bail or
for bail made under Sections 438 and 439 are denied, or where
a quashing petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure is declined, the person concerned may
have to suffer periods of incarceration for different lengths of
time. They suffer captivity and confinement most of the times
(at least where they are accused of serious offences), till the
culmination of their trial. In case of their conviction, they would
continue in confinement during the appellate stages also, and
in matters which reach the Supreme Court, till the disposal of
their appeals by this Court. By the time they are acquitted at
the appellate stage, they may have undergone long years of
custody. When acquitted by this Court, they may have suffered
imprisonment of 10 years, or more. When they are acquitted
(by the trial or the appellate court), no one returns to them; what
was wrongfully taken away from them. The system responsible
for the administration of justice, is responsible for having
deprived them of their lives, equivalent to the period of their
detention. It is not untrue, that for all the wrong reasons, innocent
persons are subjected to suffer the ignominy of criminal
prosecution and to suffer shame and humiliation. Just like it is
the bounden duty of a court to serve the cause of justice to the
victim, so also, it is the bounden duty of a court to ensure that
an innocent person is not subjected to the rigours of criminal
prosecution.
19. The situation referred to above needs to be remedied.
For the said purpose, adherence to a simple procedure could
serve the objective. We accordingly direct, that on the
completion of the investigation in a criminal case, the
prosecuting agency should apply its independent mind, and
require all shortcomings to be rectified, if necessary by
requiring further investigation. It should also be ensured, that
the evidence gathered during investigation is truly and faithfully
utilized, by confirming that all relevant witnesses and materials
for proving the charges are conscientiously presented during
the trial of a case. This would achieve two purposes. Only
persons against whom there is sufficient evidence, will have to
suffer the rigors of criminal prosecution. By following the above
procedure, in most criminal prosecutions, the concerned
agencies will be able to successfully establish the guilt of the
accused.
20. Every acquittal should be understood as a failure of
the justice delivery system, in serving the cause of justice.
Likewise, every acquittal should ordinarily lead to the inference,
that an innocent person was wrongfully prosecuted. It is
therefore, essential that every State should put in place a
procedural mechanism, which would ensure that the cause of
justice is served, which would simultaneously ensure the
safeguard of interest of those who are innocent. In furtherance

of the above purpose, it is considered essential to direct the
Home Department of every State, to examine all orders of
acquittal and to record reasons for the failure of each
prosecution case. A standing committee of senior officers of
the police and prosecution departments, should be vested with
aforesaid responsibility. The consideration at the hands of the
above committee, should be utilized for crystalizing mistakes
committed during investigation, and/or prosecution, or both. The
Home Department of every State Government will incorporate
in its existing training programmes for junior investigation/
prosecution officials course- content drawn from the above
consideration. The same should also constitute course-content
of refresher training programmes, for senior investigating/
prosecuting officials. The above responsibility for preparing
training programmes for officials, should be vested in the same
committee of senior officers referred to above. Judgments like
the one in hand (depicting more than 10 glaring lapses in the
investigation/prosecution of the case), and similar other
judgments, may also be added to the training programmes. The
course content will be reviewed by the above committee
annually, on the basis of fresh inputs, including emerging
scientific tools of investigation, judgments of Courts, and on the
basis of experiences gained by the standing committee while
examining failures, in unsuccessful prosecution of cases. We
further direct, that the above training programme be put in place
within 6 months. This would ensure that those persons who
handle sensitive matters concerning investigation/prosecution
are fully trained to handle the same. Thereupon, if any lapses
are committed by them, they would not be able to feign
innocence, when they are made liable to suffer departmental
action, for their lapses.
21. On the culmination of a criminal case in acquittal, the
concerned investigating/prosecuting official(s) responsible for
such acquittal must necessarily be identified. A finding needs
to be recorded in each case, whether the lapse was innocent
or blameworthy. Each erring officer must suffer the
consequences of his lapse, by appropriate departmental
action, whenever called for. Taking into consideration the
seriousness of the matter, the concerned official may be
withdrawn from investigative responsibilities, permanently or
temporarily, depending purely on his culpability. We also feel
compelled to require the adoption of some indispensable
measures, which may reduce the malady suffered by parties
on both sides of criminal litigation. Accordingly we direct, the
Home Department of every State Government, to formulate a
procedure for taking action against all erring investigating/
prosecuting officials/officers. All such erring officials/officers
identified, as responsible for failure of a prosecution case, on
account of sheer negligence or because of culpable lapses,
must suffer departmental action. The above mechanism
formulated would infuse seriousness in the performance of
investigating and prosecuting duties, and would ensure that
investigation and prosecution are purposeful and decisive. The
instant direction shall also be given effect to within 6 months.
22. A copy of the instant judgment shall be transmitted by
the Registry of this Court, to the Home Secretaries of all State
Governments and Union Territories, within one week. All the
concerned Home Secretaries, shall ensure compliance of the
directions recorded above. The records of consideration, in
compliance with the above direction, shall be maintained.
23. We hope and trust the Home Department of the State
of Gujarat, will identify the erring officers in the instant case, and
will take appropriate departmental action against them, as may
be considered appropriate, in accordance with law.
24. The instant criminal appeal is accordingly disposed of.

firm. During the pendency of the recovery proceedings,
plot No.722 was attached which was in the ownership of
the brother of respondent no. 1, who had died meanwhile.
On 10.6.2004, respondent no. 1 filed an objection before
the Recovery Officer stating that the attached property did
not belong to the judgment debtors, but had been
purchased by him from his brother under an unregistered
agreement of sale dated 10.1.1991. He, however, chose
to abandon the proceedings. The Recovery Officer
passed an order dated 5.5.2008, for the sale of the
property by way of public auction. As the appellant turned
to be the highest bidder, the Recovery Officer ordered the
sale of the property in his favour on 28.8.2008. On
27.11.2009, the appellant filed a writ petition before the
High Court assailing the order dated 5.5.2008 passed by
the Recovery Officer. The High Court dismissed the writ
petition. However, in the Letters Patent Appeal filed by
respondent no. 1, the Division Bench of the High Court,
besides adjudicating the matter on its merits, finally
concluded that the proceedings before the Recovery
Officer were in flagrant violation of the provisions of
r.11(2) of the Income Tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules,
and set aside the proceedings conducted by the
Recovery Officer, including the sale of the property by
public auction.

1.2. In the instant case, there is no allegation of fraud
or collusion. Therefore, irrespective of the merits of the
lis between the rival parties, namely, the Allahabad Bank
and the partners of the borrower firm, it is not open for
anyone to assail the purchase of the property made by
the auction purchaser in the public auction held in
furtherance of the order passed by the Recovery Officer
on 28.8.2008. In this view of the matter, this Court is of
the view that the High Court clearly erred while setting
aside the auction ordered in favour of the auction-
purchaser-appellant. [para 13] [265-
D-F]
1.3. The High Court in ignoring the vested right of the
appellant in the property in question, after his auction bid
was accepted and confirmed, subjected him to grave
injustice by depriving him of the property which he had
genuinely and legitimately purchased at a public auction.
It is nobody™s case that at the time of the auction-
purchase, the value of the property purchased by him
was in excess of his bid. Since it was nobody™s case that
the highest bidder at the auction conducted on 28.8.2008,
had purchased the property in question at a price lesser
than the prevailing market price, there was no justification
whatsoever to set aside the auction-purchase made by
him on account of escalation of prices thereafter. In the
considered view of this Court, not only did the Division
Bench of the High Court in the matter ignored the sound,
legal and clear principles laid down by this Court in
respect of a third party auction purchaser, it also clearly
overlooked the equitable rights vested in the auction-
purchaser during the pendency of a lis. [para 14] [266-C-
E]
1.4. Even otherwise, the objections of respondent no.
1 have no substance. The claim of respondent no. 1 in
his objection petition was based on an unregistered
agreement to sell dated 10.1.1991, which would not vest
any legal right in his favour. Further, it is apparent that it
may not have been difficult for him to have had the said
agreement to sell notarized in connivance with his
brother. Secondly, it is apparent from the factual position
that respondent no. 1 despite his having filed objections
before the Recovery Officer, had abandoned the contest
raised by him and, as such, it was not open to him to have
re-agitated the same by filing a writ petition before the
High Court. Thirdly, a remedy of appeal was available to
him in respect of the order of the Recovery Officer u/s 30.
Fourthly, respondent no. 1 could not be allowed to raise
a challenge to the public auction held on 28.8.2008
because he had not raised any objection to the
attachment of the property in question or the
proclamations and notices issued in newspapers in
connection with the auction thereof. All these facts
cumulatively lead to the conclusion that after 26.10.2005,
respondent no. 1 had lost all interest in the property in
question and had remained a silent spectator to various
orders which came to be passed from time to time. He
had, therefore, no equitable right in his favour to assail
the auction-purchase made by the appellant on 28.8.2008.
Finally, the public auction under reference was held on
28.8.2008. Thereafter the same was confirmed on
22.09.2008. Possession of the property was handed over
to the auction-purchaser on 11.3.2009. The auction-
purchaser initiated mutation proceedings in respect of the
property in question. Respondent no. 1 did not raise any

objections in the said mutation proceedings, which were

1.5. The challenges raised by respondent no. 1 ought
to have been rejected on the grounds of delay and
latches, especially because third party rights had
emerged in the meantime. More so, because the auction
purchaser was a bona fide purchaser for consideration,
having purchased the property in furtherance of a duly
publicized public auction, interference by the High Court
even on ground of equity was clearly uncalled for. The
impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside.
The right of the appellant in plot in question is confirmed.

From the Judgment & Order dated 17.05.2010 of the High
Court of Judicature at Patna in L.P.A No. 844 of 2010.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.
 1. On 11.9.1989, The
Allahabad Bank (hereinafter referred to as ‚the Bank™)
sanctioned a loan of Rs.12.70 lac to M/s. Amar Timber Works,
a partnership firm having three partners, Jagmohan Singh,
Payam Shoghi and Dev Kumar Sinha. The above loan was
sanctioned to M/s. Amar Timber Works, after its partners had
mortgaged certain properties to secure the loan amount. Since
the loan amount was not repaid in compliance with the
commitment made by M/s. Amar Timber Works, nine years
later, in 1998, the Bank preferred Original Application No.107
of 1998 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal for the recovery of
the Bank™s dues. The above Original Application was allowed
on 21.11.2000. Accordingly, a direction was issued for the
recovery of Rs.75,75,564/- from M/s. Amar Timber Works. For
the execution of the order passed by the Debt Recovery
Tribunal, the Bank initiated recovery proceedings on
28.11.2000. During the pendency of the recovery proceedings,
Jagmohan Singh, one of the partners of M/s. Amar Timber
Works, died (on 27.1.2004). On 16.4.2004, the Recovery
Officer attached plot No.722, located at Exhibition Road, P.S.
Gandhi Maidan, Patna (hereinafter referred to as ‚the property™)
measuring 1298 sq.ft. It would be pertinent to mention that the
aforesaid plot was in the ownership of Jagmohan Singh, one
of the partners in M/s. Amar Timber Works.
2. On 10.6.2004, Harender Singh, brother of Jagmohan
Singh, filed an objection petition before the Recovery Officer
alleging, that the attached property did not belong to the
judgment debtors, but had been purchased by him from his
brother Jagmohan Singh, by executing an agreement of sale
dated 10.1.1991, which was duly notarized though not
registered. It would be relevant to mention, that Harender Singh

pursued the objection petition filed by him before the Recovery
Officer till 26.10.2005, but chose to abandon the proceedings
thereafter. The order passed by the Recovery officer when the
Objector was represented for the last time on 26.10.2005 is
being extracted below:
ﬁLd. Advocate of Bank and objectors appears. Objector
reiterated his points and invited attention towards Section
53 of TP Act. Counsel of the bank submits that he had to
say nothing more than what was said/submitted earlier. He
also submits that D.Drs. was guarantor also in this case
hence his properties attached. Put up on 28.12.08 for
further hearing.
Sd/- Illegible
I/C R.O.ﬂ
3. The recovery proceedings referred to above remained
pending for a further period of more than two years. Finally, the
Recovery Officer passed an order dated 5.5.2008, for the sale
of the property by way of public auction on 4.7.2008. The
Recovery Officer fixed Rs.12.92 lacs as the reserve price, and
also fixed 28.8.2008 as the date of its auction. At the auction
held on 28.8.2008, Sadashiv Prasad Singh, was the highest
bidder. Accordingly, the Recovery Officer ordered the sale of
the property in his favour on 28.8.2008. On 22.9.2008, the
Recovery Officer, in the absence of any objections, confirmed
the sale of the property in favour of Sadashiv Prasad Singh.
The Recovery Officer also ordered, the handing over of physical
possession of the property to the auction purchaser. Sadashiv
Prasad Singh, the auction purchaser, took physical possession
of the property on 11.3.2009.
4. In furtherance of the proceedings initiated through
Mutation Case No.295/2/09-10, the land in question was
mutated in favour of the auction purchaser. It would be relevant
to mention that the application for mutation filed by the auction
purchaser, Sadashiv Prasad Singh, was supported by letter
dated 14.10.2008 of the Ministry of Finance, Government of
India, Realization Authority, Patna. It would be relevant to
mention, that no objections were filed in the mutation case
preferred by Sadashiv Prasad Singh, by or on behalf of
Harender Singh, before the Mutation Officer.
5. On 27.11.2009, CWJC No.16485 of 2009 was filed by
Harender Singh before the High Court of Judicature at Patna
(hereinafter referred to as the ‚High Court™). In the aforesaid writ
petition, Harender Singh assailed the order of the Recovery
Officer dated 5.5.2008, whereby, the property had been
ordered to be sold by public auction in discharge of the debt
owed by M/s Amar Timber Works to the Allahabad Bank. Vide
its order dated 23.3.2010, the High Court ordered the auction
purchaser, i.e. Sadashiv Prasad Singh to be impleaded as a
party-respondent. On 27.11.2010, the High Court dismissed
the above writ petition by accepting the objections raised on
behalf of the Bank, as well as, the auction purchaser by holding
as under :
ﬁThe above facts do weigh with the Court in not interfering
with the sale or the proceeding where it has been reached.
The petitioner has no satisfactory explanation for not
approaching the Court well within time challenging such a
decision or the subsequent proceedings or orders of the
Recovery Officer at an appropriate time. The conduct of
the petitioner by itself has precluded and prevented this
Court from passing any order in his favour at this belated
stage.
The writ application has not merit. It is dismissed
accordingly.ﬂ
6. Dissatisfied with the order dated 27.4.2010 whereby the
writ petition filed by Harender Singh was dismissed by a Single
Bench of the High Court, he preferred Letters Patent Appeal
No.844 of 2010. Before the Letters Patent Bench, Harender

SADASHIV PRASAD SINGH

. HARENDAR SINGH &
ORS. [JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]
Singh, brother of Jagmohan Singh, asserted that his brother
Jagmohan Singh had availed a loan of Rs.14.70 lacks. As
against the aforesaid loan amount, the Bank had initiated
proceedings before the Debt Recovery Tribunal for the
realization of a sum of 75,75,564/-. The property under
reference was sold by way of public auction to Sadashiv Prasad
Singh for a sum of Rs.13.20 lacs. As against the aforesaid sale
consideration paid by the auction purchaser, Harender Singh,
offered a sum of Rs.39 lacs before the Letters Patent Bench.
In the order passed by the Letters Patent Bench disposing of
Letters Patent Appeal No.844 of 2010, it stands noticed that
the Bank had accepted to finally settle the matter on being paid
a sum of Rs.45 lacs, subject to the condition that the Harender
Singh pays a sum of Rs.15 lacs immediately, and the balance
amount of Rs.30 lacs within a period of two years in a phased
manner. Even though the learned counsel representing the
appellant, Harender Singh was agreeable to proposal of the
Bank, the rival parties could not amicably settle the matter. It
is, therefore, that the letters patent Bench went on to adjudicate
the matter on its merits. The above factual position has been
noticed for the reason that it has a nexus to the final order which
was eventually passed by the Letters Patent Bench disposing
of LPA No.844 of 2010. In fact, it would be in the fitness of
matters to extract paragraph 8 from the impugned judgment
rendered in LPA No.844 of 2010 in order to appreciate the
niceties of the matter. The aforesaid paragraph is, accordingly,
being extracted herein :
ﬁ8. At this juncture, we may state that the brother of the
appellant had availed a loan of Rs.14.70 lacs. The said
aspect is not disputed by Mr. Ajay Kumar Sinha, learned
counsel for the Bank. The Bank had initiated a proceeding
before the Tribunal for realization of approximately a sum
of Rs.75.75 lacs. The property has been sold for Rs.13.20
lacs. It is submitted by Mr. Ojha that the prices have gone
up and he is being offered more than 39 lacs for the same.
It is not in dispute that the price, the auction-purchaser has
tendered, is Rs.13.20 lacs. On the earlier occasion, a
suggestion was given whether the Bank would accept
Rs.45 lacs in toto to settle the dispute. Mr. Sinha, learned
counsel for the Bank has obtained instructions that the
Bank has no objection to settle the same, if the appellant
pays Rs.15 lacs immediately so that the same can be paid
to the auction-purchaser and Rs.30 lacks should be paid
within a period of two years in a phased manner. Mr.
Choubey, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that
the appellant is agreeable to pay the same. Mr. Ojha
submitted that he has instructions not to accept the
suggestion.ﬂ
7. During the course of appellate proceedings, the High
Court referred to Chapter V of the Recovery of Debts Due to
Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (hereinafter referred
to as the Debt Recoveries Act) and particularly to Section 29
which is being extracted hereunder:
ﬁ
29. Application of certain provisions of Income-tax
Act.Š
The provisions of the Second and Third Schedules
to the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961) and the Income-
tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules, 1962, as in force from
time to time shall, as far as possible, apply with necessary
modifications as if the said provisions and the rules
referred to the amount of debt due under this Act instead
of to the Income-tax :
Provided that any reference under the said
provisions and the rules to the ﬁassesseeﬂ shall be
construed as a reference to the defendant under this Act.ﬂ
The High Court while interpreting Section 29 extracted
above, concluded that certain provisions of the Income Tax Act
and Income Tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules would be
applicable mutatis mutandis in the matter of recovery of debts
under the Debt Recoveries Act. The High Court then referred
to Rule 11 of the Income Tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules

and arrived at the conclusion that sub-rule (2) of Rule 11, had
not been complied with by the Recovery Officer, inasmuch as,
the objection raised by Harender Singh had not been
adjudicated upon. As such, the High Court finally concluded that
the proceedings before the Recovery Officer were in flagrant
violation of the provisions of Rule 11(2) of the Income Tax
(Certificate Proceedings) Rules. Having so concluded, the High
Court set aside the proceedings conducted by the Recovery
Officer, including the sale of the property by public auction. In
order to appreciate the basis of the order passed by the High
Court, Rule 11 of the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act,
1961, is being extracted herein:
ﬁInvestigation by Tax Recovery Officer.
11. (1)  Where any claim is preferred to, or any objection
is made to the attachment or sale of, any property in
execution of a certificate, on the ground that such property
is not liable to such attachment or sale, the Tax Recovery
Officer shall proceed to investigate the claim or objection:
Provided that no such investigation shall be made where
the Tax Recovery Officer considers that the claim or
objection was designedly or unnecessarily delayed.
(2) Where the property to which the claim or objection
applies has been advertised for sale, the Tax Recovery
Officer ordering the sale may postpone it pending the
investigation of the claim or objection, upon such terms as
to security or otherwise as the Tax Recovery Officer shall
deem fit.
(3)
The claimant or objector must adduce evidence to
show that-
(a) (in the case of immovable property) at the date
of the service of the notice issued under this
Schedule to pay the arrears, or
(b) (in the case of movable property) at the date of
the attachment,
he had some interest in, or was possessed of, the
property in question.
(4) Where, upon the said investigation, the Tax Recovery
Officer is satisfied that, for the reason stated in the claim
or objection, such property was not, at the said date, in the
possession of the defaulter or of some person in truest for
him or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying
rent to him, or that, being in the possession of the defaulter
at the said date, it was so in his possession, not on his
own account or as his own property, but on account of or
in trust for some other person, or partly on his own account
and partly on account of some other person, the Tax
Recovery Officer shall make an order releasing the
property, wholly or to such extent as he thinks fit, from
attachment or sale.
(5) Where the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that the
property was, at the said date, in the possession of the
defaulter as his own property and not on account of any
other person, or was in the possession of some other
person in trust for him, or in the occupancy of a tenant or
other person paying rent to him, the Tax Recovery Officer
shall disallow the claim.
(6) Where a claim or an objection is preferred, the party
against whom an order is made may institute a suit in a
civil court to establish the right which he claims to the
property in dispute; but, subject to the result of such suit
(if any), the order of the Tax Recovery Officer shall be
conclusive.ﬂ
8. Having dealt with the controversy in the manner
expressed in the foregoing paragraphs, the Division Bench of
the High Court was of the view that the matter in hand ought to

be settled by working out the equities between the parties.
Accordingly, the High Court disposed of the matter in the
following manner:
ﬁ12. Though we have held the same could not have been
sold in auction, yet equities are to be worked out. Regard
being had to the fact that the respondent-purchaser has
deposited Rs.13.20 lac between 28.8.2008 to 22.9.2009
and thus the amount is with the Bank for almost more than
one year and 10 months and thereafter there had been
challenge to the order in the writ petition and after
dismissal of the writ petition the present L.P.A. has been
filed in quite promptitude and that the amount of the
respondent-purchaser was blocked, it will be obligatory on
the part of the appellant to compensate the respondent-
purchaser at least by way of payment of interest at the Bank
rate. We are disposed to think that if a sum of Rs.17 lacs
is paid to the auction-purchaser, it would sub-serve the
cause of justice and house of the appellant shall be saved
and, accordingly, it is directed that the appellant shall
deposit a sum of Rs.17 lacks within a period of four weeks
from today in the Bank. After such deposit, the Bank shall
hand it over to the purchaser by way of a bank draft. The
same shall be sent by registered post with
acknowledgment due. Thereafter the appellant shall
deposit a further sum of Rs.32 lacs within a period of two
years; sum of Rs.16 lacs by 25th March, 2011 and further
sum of Rs.16 lacs by 25th March, 2012. Needless to say
pro-rate interest shall accrue in favour of the Bank for the
said period.
13. After the amount is paid to the purchaser, it would be
the duty of the Recovery Officer to hand over the
possession to the appellant.ﬂ
9. Sadashiv Prasad Singh, the auction purchaser, has
assailed the impugned order passed by the Division Bench of
the High Court in LPA No.844 of 2010 praying for the setting
aside of the order by which he has been deprived of the
property purchased by him in the public auction held on
28.8.2008, which was subsequently confirmed by the Recovery
Officer of the Debt Recovery Tribunal on 23.9.2008. This
challenge has been made by Sadashiv Prasad Singh by filing
Special Leave Petition (C) No.23000 of 2010. The impugned
order passed by the High Court on 17.5.2010, has also been
assailed by Harender Singh by preferring Special Leave
Petition (C) No.26550 of 2010. The prayer made by Harender
Singh is, that order passed by the Division Bench places him
in the shoes of the auction purchaser, and as such, he could
have only been asked to pay a sum of Rs.17 lacs. Requiring
him to pay a further sum of Rs.32 lacs is unsustainable in law,
and accordingly, deserved to be set aside.
10. Leave granted in both the Special Leave Petitions.
11. For the narration of facts, we have relied upon the
pleadings and the documents appended to Special Leave
Petition (C) No.23000 of 2010.
12. Learned counsel for the auction purchaser Sadashiv
Prasad Singh, in the first instance vehemently contended, that
in terms of the law declared by this Court, property purchased
by a third party auction purchaser, in compliance of a court
order, cannot be interfered with on the basis of the success or
failure of parties to a proceeding, if auction purchaser had
bonafidely purchased the property. In order to substantiate his
aforesaid contention, learned counsel representing Sadashiv
Prasad Singh placed emphatic reliance, firstly, on a judgment
rendered by this Court in 
Ashwin S. Mehta & Anr. vs.
Custodian & Ors., 
(2006) 2 SCC 385). Our attention was
drawn to the following observations recorded therein :
ﬁIn that view of the matter, evidently, creation of any third-
party interest is no longer in dispute nor the same is
subject to any order of this Court. In any event, ordinarily,
a bona fide purchaser for value in an auction-sale is

treated differently than a decree-holder purchasing such
properties. In the former event, even if such a decree is
set aside, the interest of the bona fide purchaser in an
auction-sale is saved
. (See 
Nawab Zain-ul-Abdin Khan
v. Mohd. Asghar Ali Khan (1887) 15 IA 12)
 The said
decision has been affirmed by this Court in 
Gurjoginder
Singh v. Jaswant Kaur (1994) 2 SCC 368).ﬂ
(emphasis is ours)
On the same subject, and to the same end, learned
counsel placed reliance on another judgment rendered by this
Court in 
Janatha Textiles & Ors. vs. Tax Recovery Officer &
Anr.,
 (2008) 12 SCC 582, wherein the conclusions drawn in
Ashwin S. Mehta™s case (supra) came to be reiterated. In the
above judgment, this Court relied upon the decisions of the
Privy Council and of this Court in 
Nawab Zain-Ul-Abdin Khan
v. Mohd. Asghar Ali Khan,
 (1887-88) 15 IA 12;
 Janak Raj vs.
Gurdial Singh, 
AIR 1967 SC 608; 
Gurjoginder Singh vs.
Jaswant Kaur, 
(1994) 2 SCC 368; 
Padanathil Ruqmini Amma
vs. P.K. Abdulla, 
(1996) 7 SCC 668, as also, on 
Ashwin S.
Mehta 
(supra) in order to conclude, that it is an established
principle of law, that a third party auction purchaser™s interest,
in the auctioned property continues to be protected,
notwithstanding that the underlying decree is subsequently set
aside or otherwise. It is, therefore, that this Court in its ultimate
analysis observed as under:
ﬁ
20
. 
Law makes a clear distinction between a stranger
who is a bona fide purchaser of the property at an auction-
sale and a decree-holder purchaser at a court auction. The
strangers to the decree are afforded protection by the
court because they are not connected with the decree
.
Unless the protection is extended to them the court sales
would not fetch market value or fair price of the property.ﬂ
(emphasis is ours)
On the issue as has been dealt with in the foregoing paragraph,
this Court has carved out one exception. The aforesaid
exception came to be recorded in 
Velji Khimji and Company
vs. Official Liquidator of Hindustan Nitro Product (Gujarat)
Limited & Ors.,
 (2008) 9 SCC 299, wherein it was held as
under :
ﬁ
30
. 
In the first case mentioned above i.e. where the
auction is not subject to confirmation by any authority, the
auction is complete on the fall of the hammer, and certain
rights accrue in favour of the auction-purchaser. However,
where the auction is subject to subsequent confirmation by
some authority
 (under a statute or terms of the auction) the
auction is not complete and no rights accrue until the sale
is confirmed by the said authority. 
Once, however, the sale
is confirmed by that authority, certain rights accrue in
favour of the auction-purchaser, and these rights cannot be
extinguished except in exceptional cases such as fraud
.
31
. 
In the present case, the auction having been confirmed
on 30.7.2003 by the Court it cannot be set aside unless
some fraud or collusion has been proved. We are satisfied
that no fraud or collusion has been established by anyone
in this case
.ﬂ
(emphasis is ours)
It is, therefore, apparent that the rights of an auction-
purchaser in the property purchased by him cannot be
extinguished except in cases where the said purchase can be
assailed on grounds of fraud or collusion.
13. It is imperative for us, to adjudicate upon the veracity
of the sale of the property by way of public auction, made in
favour of Sadashiv Prasad Singh on 28.8.2008. It is not a matter
of dispute, that the lis in the present controversy was between
the Allahabad Bank on the one hand and the partners of M/s.

SADASHIV PRASAD SINGH 
v
. HARENDAR SINGH &
ORS. [JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.]
and Dev Kumar Sinha on the other. Sadashiv Prasad Sinha
was not a party to the proceedings before the Debt Recovery
Tribunal or before the Recovery Officer. By an order dated
5.5.2008, the Recovery Officer ordered the sale of the property
by way of public auction. On 4.7.2008, the Recovery Officer
fixed Rs.12.92 lacs as the reserve price, and also fixed
28.8.2008 as the date of auction. At the public auction held on
28.8.2008, Sadashiv Prasad Sinha was the highest bidder, and
accordingly, the Recovery officer ordered the sale of the
property in his favour on 28.8.2008. In the absence of any
objections, the Recovery Officer confirmed the sale of the
property in favour of Sadashiv Prasad Sinha on 22.9.2008.
Thereafter possession of the property was also handed over
to the auction-purchaser on 11.3.2009. Applying the law
declared by this Court in the judgments referred in the foregoing
paragraphs irrespective of the merits of the lis between the rival
parties, namely, the Allahabad Bank and the partners of M/s.
Amar Timber Works, it is not open for anyone to assail the
purchase of the property made by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha in
the public auction held in furtherance of the order passed by
the Recovery Officer on 28.8.2008. In the above view of the
matter, especially in the absence of any allegation of fraud or
collusion, we are of the view that the High Court clearly erred
while setting aside the auction ordered in favour of the auction-
purchaser, Sadashiv Prasad Sinha in the impugned order
dated 17.5.2010.
14. A perusal of the impugned order especially paragraphs
8, 12 and 13 extracted hereinabove reveal that the impugned
order came to be passed in order to work out the equities
between the parties. The entire deliberation at the hands of the
High Court were based on offers and counter offers, inter se
between the Allahabad Bank on the one hand and the objector
Harender Singh on the other, whereas the rights of Sadashiv
Prasad Sinha Œ the auction-purchaser, were not at all taken into
consideration. As a matter of fact, it is Sadashiv Prasad Sinha
who was to be deprived of the property which came to be
vested in him as far back as on 28.8.2008. It is nobody™s case,
that at the time of the auction-purchase, the value of the property
purchased by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha was in excess of his bid.
In fact, the factual position depicted under paragraph 8 of the
impugned judgment reveals, that the escalation of prices had
taken place thereafter, and the value of the property purchased
by Sadashiv Prasad Sinha was presently much higher than the
bid amount. Since it was nobody™s case that Sadashiv Prasad
Sinha, the highest bidder at the auction conducted on
28.8.2008, had purchased the property in question at a price
lesser than the then prevailing market price, there was no
justification whatsoever to set aside the auction-purchase made
by him on account of escalation of prices thereafter. The High
Court in ignoring the vested right of the appellant in the property
in question, after his auction bid was accepted and confirmed,
subjected him to grave injustice by depriving him to property
which he had genuinely and legitimately purchased at a public
auction. In our considered view, not only did the Division Bench
of the High Court in the matter by ignoring the sound, legal and
clear principles laid down by this Court in respect of a third party
auction purchaser, the High Court also clearly overlooked the
equitable rights vested in the auction-purchaser during the
pendency of a lis. The High Court also clearly overlooked the
equitable rights vested in the auction purchaser while disposing
of the matter.
15. At the time of hearing, we were thinking of remanding
the matter to the Recovery Officer to investigate into the
objection of Harender Singh under Rule 11 of the Second
Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1961. But considering the
delay such a remand may cause, we have ourselves examined
the objections of Harender Singh and reject the objections for
a variety of reasons. Firstly, the contention raised at the hands
of the respondents before the High Court, that the facts narrated
by Harender Singh (the appellant in Special Leave Petition (C)
No.26550 of 2010) were a total sham, as he was actually the
brother of one of the judgment-debtors, namely, Jagmohan

Singh. And that Harender Singh had created an unbelievable
story with the connivance and help of his brother, so as to save
the property in question. The claim of Harender Singh in his
objection petition, was based on an unregistered agreement
to sell dated 10.1.1991. Not only that such an agreement to sell
would not vest any legal right in his favour; it is apparent that it
may not have been difficult for him to have had the aforesaid
agreement to sell notarized in connivance with his brother, for
the purpose sought to be achieved. Secondly, it is apparent
from the factual position depicted in the foregoing paragraphs
that Harender Singh, despite his having filed objections before
the Recovery Officer, had abandoned the contest raised by him
by not appearing (and by not being represented) before the
Recovery Officer after 26.10.2005, whereas, the Recovery
Officer had passed the order of sale of the property by way of
public auction more than two years thereafter, only on 5.5.2008.
Having abandoned his claim before the Recovery Officer, it was
not open to him to have reagitated the same by filing a writ
petition before the High Court. Thirdly, a remedy of appeal was
available to Harender Singh in respect of the order of the
Recovery Officer assailed by him before the High Court under
Section 30, which is being extracted herein to assail the order
dated 5.5.2008:
ﬁ
30. Appeal against the order of Recovery Officer.Š
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 29, any
person aggrieved by an order of the Recovery Officer
made under this Act may, within thirty days from the date
on which a copy of the order is issued to him, prefer an
appeal to the Tribunal.
(2) On receipt of an appeal under sub-section (1), the
Tribunal may, after giving an opportunity to the appellant
to be heard, and after making such inquiry as it deems fit,
confirm, modify or set aside the order made by the
Recovery Officer in exercise of his powers under section
25 to 28 (both inclusive).ﬂ
The High Court ought not to have interfered with in the
matter agitated by Harender Singh in exercise of its writ
jurisdiction. In fact, the learned Single Judge rightfully dismissed
the writ petition filed by Harender Singh. Fourthly, Harender
Singh could not be allowed to raise a challenge to the public
auction held on 28.8.2008 because he had not raised any
objection to the attachment of the property in question or the
proclamations and notices issued in newspapers in connection
with the auction thereof. All these facts cumulatively lead to the
conclusion that after 26.10.2005, Harender Singh had lost all
interest in the property in question and had therefore, remained
a silent spectator to various orders which came to be passed
from time to time. He had, therefore, no equitable right in his
favour to assail the auction-purchase made by Sadashiv
Prasad Sinha on 28.8.2008. Finally, the public auction under
reference was held on 28.8.2008. Thereafter the same was
confirmed on 22.09.2008. Possession of the property was
handed over to the auction-purchaser Sadashiv Prasad Sinha
on 11.3.2009. The auction-purchaser initiated mutation
proceedings in respect of the property in question. Harender
Singh did not raise any objections in the said mutation
proceedings. The said mutation proceedings were also
finalized in favour of Sadashiv Prasad Sinha. Harender Singh
approached the High Court through CWJC No.16485 of 209
only on 27.11.2009. We are of the view that the challenged
raised by Harender Singh ought to have been rejected on the
grounds of delay and latches, especially because third party
rights had emerged in the meantime. More so, because the
auction purchaser was a bona fide purchaser for consideration,
having purchased the property in furtherance of a duly
publicized public auction, interference by the High Court even
on ground of equity was clearly uncalled for.
For the reasons recorded hereinabove, we are of the view
that the impugned order dated 17.5.2010 passed by the High
Court allowing Letters Patent Appeal No.844 of 2010 deserves
to be set aside. The same is accordingly set aside. The right

benefits which would have been so due to him.
Promotion during extension of service Œ Held: The

for promotion as Lieutenant General was declined by ACC is
rejected Œ Accordingly, operative part of order of ACC is set
aside.
Constitution of India, 1950:
Arts. 14 and 16 Œ Claim for promotion Œ Held:
Division
Bench of High Court has rightly held that recommendations
of Selection Board were merely recommendatory in nature
and, therefore, appellant had no fundamental right for
promotion solely on the basis of such recommendation Œ
However, non-consideration of claim of appellant would violate
fundamental rights vested in him under Arts. 14 and 16, as
respondents were desirous of filling up the said vacancy and
appellant being the senior most serving Major General
eligible for consideration had fundamental right of being
considered against the said vacancy, and also the
fundamental right of being promoted if he was adjudged
suitable Œ It was in order to extend the benefit of the
fundamental right enshrined under Art. 14 of India, that he was
allowed extension in service on two occasions by Presidential
orders Œ By the said orders, respondents desired to treat the
appellant justly, so as to enable him to acquire the honour of
promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, in case the
recommendation made in his favour by the Selection Board
was approved by ACC Œ The action of authorities in depriving
the appellant due consideration for promotion to the rank of
the Lieutenant General, would have been arbitrary and
resulted in violation of his fundamental right under Art. 14.
The appellant, who was commissioned as Second
Lieutenant in the Indian Army on 15.6.1969 and was
inducted into the Armoured Corps, permanently moved
into the Defence Research and Development
Organisation (DRDO) w.e.f. 25.5.1983, where he rose up
to the rank of Major General. In the Government of India
gazette published on 6.12.2007 the appellant was shown
as having been promoted as substantive Major General
with effect from 7.1.2004. A vacancy in the rank of
Lieutenant General became available with effect from
1.1.2007. The appellant, as Major General, would retire at
the age of 59 years, on 29.2.2008 but on his promotion
to the rank of Lieutenant General his age of retirement
would stand extended to 28.2.2009 i.e., up to 60 years. On
27.2.2008 i.e. two days prior to the appellant™s retirement
on superannuation a meeting of the Selection Board for
promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General was
convened. The Selection Board recommended only the
name of the appellant for promotion. The President of
India by an order dated 29.2.2008, granted the appellant
extension of service, for a period of three months and a
further extension in service for a period of one month i.e.,

up to 30.6.2008 or ﬁtill the approval of the Appointments
Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), whichever was earlierﬂ.
On 2.6.2008, the Secretariat of the ACC issued a
communication to the effect that ACC did not approve the
promotion of the appellant to the rank of Lieutenant
General. Consequently, the appellant retired from the rank
of Major General w.e.f. 3.6.2008. The appellant filed a writ
petition before the High Court. The stand of the Union of
India was that the appellant having attained the age of
superannuation on 29.2.2008, he could not be promoted
as Lieutenant General ﬁwhile he was on extensionﬂ. Writ
petition was dismissed by the single Judge of the High
Court. The Division Bench also dismissed the writ appeal
of the appellant.
Allowing the appeal, the Court
HELD: 1.1. The Division Bench of the High Court has
rightly held that the recommendations of the Selection
Board were merely recommendatory in nature and,
therefore, the appellant had no fundamental right for
promotion solely on the basis of the recommendation of
the Selection Board. [para 12] [284-F, G-H]

Food
Corporation of India and Others Vs. Parashotam Das Bansal
and Others,
 
(2008) 5 SCC 100 - referred to.
1.2. However, it is significant to note that the
Appointments Committee of the Cabinet did not in any
manner upset the finding recorded by the Selection
Board, in respect of the merit and suitability of the
appellant for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General.
Therefore, the appellant must be deemed to have been
found suitable for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General, even by the ACC. [Para 20]
1.3. The vacancy against which the claim of the
appellant was considered, had arisen on 1.1.2007, and he
was the senior most eligible officer holding the rank of
Major General whose name fell in the zone of
consideration for promotion. The Selection Board also
having conducted its deliberations, singularly chose his
name from the panel of four names before it and
recommended him for promotion. Having been so
recommended, the President of India , in the first
instance, by an order dated 29.2.2008, extended the
service of the appellant, for the period of three months
with effect from 1.3.2008 and by another order dated
30.5.2008 for a further period of one month with effect
from 1.6.2008, ﬁor till the approval of the ACC whichever
is earlierﬂ. The President of India, therefore, was
conscious of the fact while granting extension in service
to the appellant that his case for promotion to the rank
of Lieutenant General was under consideration. It cannot
be accepted that the said determination in allowing
extension in service to the appellant can be described as
being in violation of the norms stipulated in r 16A of the
Army Rules. The delay in convening the Selection Board
and conducting its proceedings may not be deliberate or
mala fide, but since the Selection Board came to be
convened for the vacancy which had arisen on 1.1.2007
only on 27.2.2008, the respondents must squarely
shoulder the blame and responsibility of the delay. [para
21] [296-A-C, E and 297-B-C]
2.1. The non-consideration of the claim of the
appellant would violate the fundamental rights vested in
him under Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution, as the
respondents were desirous of filling up the said vacancy.
In this view of the matter, the appellant being the senior
most serving Major General eligible for consideration,
most definitely had the fundamental right of being

considered against the said vacancy, and also the
fundamental right of being promoted if he was adjudged
suitable. It was in order to extend the benefit of the
fundamental right enshrined under Art. 14 of the
Constitution, that he was allowed extension in service on
two occasions. By the said orders, the respondents
desired to treat the appellant justly, so as to enable him
to acquire the honour of promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General, in case the recommendation made in
his favour by the Selection Board was approved by the
ACC. The action of the authorities in depriving the
appellant due consideration for promotion to the rank of
the Lieutenant General, would have resulted in violation
of his fundamental right under Art. 14 of the Constitution
of India. Such an action at the hands of the respondents
would unquestionably have been arbitrary. [para 22] [297-
D-G; 298-C]
2.2. The Presidential orders allowing extension of
service to the appellant so as to enable his claim to be
considered for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General, cannot be held to be in violation of the statutory
provisions. Rule 16A of the Army Rules, postulates
extension in service, if the exigencies of service so
require. The said parameter must have been duly taken
into consideration when the two Presidential orders were
passed. The respondents have neither revoked, nor
sought revocation of the said orders. Therefore, the
respondents cannot question the veracity of the said
orders, which were passed to ensure due consideration
of the appellant™s claim for promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General. Without rejecting the claim on merits,
the appellant was deprived of promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General. [para 22] [298-C-G]
2.3. Besides, this Court is of the considered view, that
consideration of the promotional claim of the senior most
eligible officer, would also fall in the parameters of the rule
providing for extension, if the exigencies of service so
require. It would be a sad day if the armed forces decline
to give effect to the legitimate expectations of the highest
ranked armed forces personnel, specially when, blame
for delay in such consideration, rests squarely on the
shoulders of the authorities themselves. Surely,
extension of service, for the purpose granted to the
appellant, would most definitely fall within the realm of
r.16A of the Army Rules. Accordingly, extension in
service granted to the appellant, for all intents and
purposes, in the considered view of this Court, will be
deemed to satisfy the parameters of ‚exigency of service™,
stipulated in r. 16A of the Army Rules. [Para 22] [298-H;
299-A-B, C-D]
2.4. The deliberations of the Appointments
Committee of the Cabinet make it clear that where an
officer attains the age of retirement without there being
a vacancy for his consideration to a higher rank, even
though he is eligible for the same, and such an officer is
granted extension in service, he cannot claim
consideration for promotion against a vacancy which
has become available during the period of his extension
in service. Retention in service, so as to consider an
officer for a vacancy which has not become available
prior to his retirement, but is in the offing, cannot be
allowed. [para 24] [300-C-F]
2.5. In the instant case, a clear vacancy against the
rank of Lieutenant General became available with effect
from 1.1.2007. At that juncture, the appellant had 14
months of service remaining. It is not as if the vacancy
came into existence after the appellant had reached the
age of retirement on superannuation. The denial of
promotion to the appellant mainly for the reason, that the
appellant was on extension in service, is unsustainable
besides being arbitrary, specially in the light of the fact
that the vacancy had become available, well before the

date of his retirement on superannuation. Therefore, the
basis on which the claim of the appellant for promotion
to the rank of Lieutenant General was declined by the
ACC, is rejected. Accordingly, the operative part of the
order of the ACC is set aside. [para 24] [300-H; 301-A-C]
2.6. It is apparent, that the Selection Board had
recommended the promotion of the appellant on the
basis of his record of service, past performance, qualities
of leadership, as well as vision, out of a panel of four
names. The ACC, in its deliberations, did not record any
reason to negate the said recommendation. Therefore,
that the appellant deserves promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General, from the date due to him. Ordered
accordingly. On account of his promotion to the post of
Lieutenant General, the appellant would also be entitled
to continuation in service till the age of retirement on
superannuation stipulated for Lieutenant Generals, i.e., till
his having attained the age of 60 years. As such, the
appellant shall be deemed to have been in service against
the rank of Lieutenant General till 28.2.2009, and
accordingly, entitled to all monetary benefits which would
have been so due to him. [para 25] [301-D-F]

of 2014.

Court of Madras in Writ Appeal No. 779 of 2009.
H.M. Singh (Petitioner-In-Person).
Paras Kuhad, ASG, Brijender Chahar, Chandra Bhushan
Prasad, Anil Katiyar for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR, J.
 1. The appellant was
commissioned as Second Lieutenant in the Indian Army on
15.6.1969. His initial induction was into the Armoured Corps.
On 25.5.1983 the appellant changed his cadre. He permanently
moved into the Defence Research and Development
Organisation (hereinafter referred to as ‚the DRDO™). Having
gone through decades of rigorous military service and having
consistently earned onward promotions to higher ranks, as
were due to him from time to time, he was granted acting rank
of Major General on 1.6.2004, after he had been approved for
promotion to the rank of Major General by a duly constituted
Selection Board.
2. On 31.3.2005 Lieutenant General Ravinder Nath retired
from service. Resultantly a vacancy in the rank of Lieutenant
General became available. On 1.1.2006 the appellant claims
to have become eligible for the consideration for promotion to
the above vacancy. It would be relevant to mention, that at that
juncture, in the cadre of Major Generals, the appellant was the
senior most serving officer (as per seniority list dated
29.12.2006) eligible for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General. In the Government of India gazette (published on
6.12.2007) the appellant was shown as having been promoted
as substantive Major General with effect from 7.1.2004. It would
also be relevant to mention, that the name of the appellant was
included in the name announced by the President of India for
the award of the Vishist Seva Medal on 26.1.2007. The said
award was sought to be bestowed
 
upon the appellant, for his
having rendered distinguished service of an exceptional order
to the nation. It is therefore, that the appellant was desirous, that
his claim be considered for onward promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General. At that juncture, the appellant had not only
held the rank of Major General for more 18 months, he had also

earned two confidential reports in the said rank. The record
appended to the pleadings indicates, that he had also been
granted vigilance clearance. Despite the above, the appellant
was not considered eligible for promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General as he had not completed two years™ service
in the rank of Major General at that time.
3. Under the circumstances mentioned in the foregoing
paragraph, AVM R. Yadav, an officer from the Indian Air Force
was inducted into the DRDO on 29.12.2005, against the
vacancy in the rank of Lieutenant General created by Lieutenant
General Ravinder Nath. AVM R. Yadav retired from service with
effect from 31.12.2006. As such, a vacancy in the rank of
Lieutenant General became available with effect from 1.1.2007.
4. On 30.4.2007, the appellant addressed a representation
to the Director General DRDO asserting, that he was eligible
for promotion against the existing vacancy of Lieutenant
General, as he fulfilled the laid down criteria. He expressly
pointed out in his above representation, that in the event of his
promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General his age of
retirement would stand extended.
 
As Major General he would
retire at the age of 59 years, on 29.2.2008 (as the appellant
date of birth is 2.2.1949). On his promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General his age of retirement would stand extended
to 28.2.2009 i.e., to 60 years. The appellant therefore
requested the authorities, to immediately constitute and
convene a meeting of the Selection Board, for considering his
claim for onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General.
For the above purpose, the appellant also met various higher
authorities. On all such occasions he was informed, that the
action to convene a meeting of the Selection Board was under
process. In fact, in November, 2007 the appellant was assured,
that the meeting of Selection Board would be held in
December, 2007. He was also assured, that in the event of his
being considered suitable for promotion by the Selection
Board, he will actually be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant
General, before the date of his retirement (29.2.2008) as Major
General.
5
. Since the date of appellant™s retirement Œ 29.2.2008
was fast-approaching, and because it seemed to the appellant
that nothing was moving, the appellant submitted his grievance
to the authorities in writing, praying for immediate action in the
matter. In this behalf he also sought personal hearing, to
present his case. These pleas were raised by the appellant
through separate communications dated 26.12.2007 (to the SA
to the Defence Minister, and to the DRDO). On 28.2.2008 he
addressed a letter for the same purpose, to the Personal
Secretary to the Defence Minister.
6. Two days prior to the appellant™s retirement on
superannuation (29.2.2008, as Major General), on 27.2.2008
a meeting of the Selection Board for promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General was convened. The Selection Board
cleared the appellant for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General. The Selection Board cleared only the name of the
appellant for the above promotion, from out of a panel of 4
names.
7. In order to ensure that the appellant™s claim for
promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General is not frustrated,
the President of India by an order dated 29.2.2008, was
pleased to grant the appellant extension of service, for a period
of three months. A relevant extract of the above order is being
reproduced hereinunder:
ﬁI am directed to convey 
the sanction of the President to
the grant of extension in service to IC-23289 Maj Gen H.M.

their Dy No. 582/Fin (R&D) dated 29 Feb 2008.ﬂ
(emphasis is ours)
A perusal of the above communication reveals, that the
aforesaid extension of service was granted to the appellant, to
await the approval of the Appointments Committee of the
Cabinet. In this behalf it would be relevant to mention, that in
the process of consideration for promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General, the recommendation made by the Selection
Board requires the approval of the Appointments Committee
of the Cabinet, before it is given effect to. It is apparent that
the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, could not finalise
the matter during the appellant™s extended tenure of three
months. As such, for the same reasons, the President of India
was pleased to grant the appellant a further extension in service
(as Major General) for a period of one month i.e., up to
30.6.2008 or till the approval of the Appointments Committee
of the Cabinet, whichever was earlier.
8. On 2.6.2008, the Secretariat of the Appointments
Committee of the Cabinet (Ministry of Personnel, Public
Grievances and Pensions, Department of Personnel and
Training) issued a communication with the following
observations:
ﬁ2. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has not
approved the promotion of IC-23289 Maj Gen H.M. Singh,
a permanently seconded officer of DRDO, to the rank of
Lieutenant General.ﬂ
In consonance with the order granting extension in service,
the DRDO issued an order dated 3.6.2008, retiring the appellant
from the rank of Major General with immediate effect. The
appellant assailed the above order dated 2.6.2008 (denying the
appellant promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General), and the
order dated 3.6.2008 (by which the appellant was retired from
service) by filing Writ Petition No. 15508 of 2008 before the
High Court of Judicature at Madras (hereinafter referred to as
‚the High Court™). Convening a meeting of the Selection Board
on 27.2.2008 i.e., just two days before the appellant was to
retire on attaining the age of superannuation, as also, the
consideration of the recommendation made by the Selection
Board at the hands of the Appointments Committee of the
Cabinet, more than three months after the date on which the
appellant would retire from service, were vigorously referred to,
to demonstrate the apathy at the hands of the authorities, which
according to the appellant, had resulted in denial of promotion
to him.
9. In response to the alleged delay in the matter of
considering the appellant™s claim for promotion, it was pointed
out that the DRDO had a large number of high value projects
viz. design, development and production of Light Combat
Aircraft, design and development of Kaveri Engine, design and
development of Airborne Early Warning System and a number
of projects related to upgradation of avionics and electronics
warfare system, Sukhoi, MIG-27 and LCA; accordingly a
decision was taken by the DRDO i.e., the appellant™s controlling
authority, to earmark the vacancy of Lieutenant General (against
which the appellant was claiming consideration), for an officer
of equivalent rank from the Indian Air Force, who would be in a
position to oversee, provide guidance and coordinate all the
abovementioned highly sensitive and intricate projects. The
above tentative determination for filling up the vacancy of
Lieutenant General from the Indian Air Force was, however,
subsequently reviewed in consultation with the Government of
India. The Government of India on 14.2.2008 finally decided to
fill up the vacancy of Lieutenant General by promotion of a
permanently seconded service officer of the DRDO. It was
therefore asserted, that non-holding of the meeting of the
Selection Board, and the non-finalisation of the consideration
of the appellant™s claim for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General, could not be described as a deliberate and intentional

attempt by the authorities to deprive the appellant of his
promotional opportunity.
10. In its pleadings the Union of India adopt a clear stand,
that the appellant having attained the age of superannuation on
29.2.2008, could not be promoted as Lieutenant General ﬁwhile
he was on extensionﬂ. It was also the contention of the Union
of India, that since the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet
had not approved the appellant™s promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General, the same could not be challenged specially
because the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet had
given valid reasons to defer the recommendation of the
Selection Board / Departmental Promotion Committee. The
Union of India acknowledged, that the Appointments Committee
of the Cabinet was the competent authority to approve the
recommendation for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General
(made by the Selection Board). It was admitted, that the
Selection Board in its meeting held on 27.2.2008 had
recommended the appellant for promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General. Pending approval of the Appointments
Committee of the Cabinet, the appellant had crossed the age
of his retirement on superannuation (in the rank of Major
General, on 29.2.2008). Thereafter, the appellant was granted
extension in service beyond the period of his retirement up to
30.6.2008.
11. Having considered the contentions and prayers made
by the appellant, a Single Bench of the High Court while
disposing of the Writ Petition No. 15508 of 2008, recorded the
following observations:
ﬁ40. When the petitioner™s extension of service was not on
the ground of exigency, DRDO being mainly civilian, Rules
do not permit promotion on extension. ACC™s action in not
granting approval to the recommendation made by
Selection Board is in accordance with the Rules and the
same cannot be assailed. Petitioner cannot contend that
he has been discriminated in not granting promotion while
on extension.
41. There is no substance in the contention that the
Petitioner having been extended his service, he ought to
have been granted promotion. Extension of service does
not give rise the legitimate expectation for promotion. The
extensions in tenure were given to the petitioner to ensure
that procedure relating to approval of competent authority
on the recommendation of Selection Board was
completed in an objective manner by following prescribed
process. On culmination of process, ACC is the competent
authority came to the decision not to promote the
petitioner. As such there is not incoherence and
arbitrariness in the decision warranting exercise of judicial
review.ﬂ
In the light of the above observations Writ Petition No.
15508 of 2008 was dismissed on 5.5.2009.
12. Dissatisfied with the dismissal of Writ Petition No.
15508 of 2008, the appellant filed an intra court Writ Appeal
No. 779 of 2009. In the process of adjudicating upon the
controversy raised in the abovementioned Writ Appeal, a
Division Bench of the High Court framed two questions for its
consideration. Firstly, whether the appellant Major General H.M.
Singh had any fundamental right for promotion solely on the
basis of the recommendation of the Selection Board. And
secondly, whether Appointments Committee of the Cabinet was
liable to accept the recommendation made by the Selection
Board in favour of the appellant, and consequently, order the
appellant™s promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. Relying
on paragraph 108 of the Regulation of Army which delineates
the constitution and duties of the Selection Board, the Division
Bench concluded that the recommendations of the Selection
Board were merely recommendatory in nature, and therefore,
answered the first question in the negative. The Division Bench
further held, that a legitimate claim for the promotion would

arise, only if a recommendation made by the Selection Board
gets the approval of the Appointments Committee of the
Cabinet. Relying on the judgments rendered by this Court in
Dr. H. Mukherjee Vs. Union of India and Others,
 1994 Supp.
(1) SCC 250, 
Union of India and Others Vs. N.P. Dhamania
and Others, 
1995 Supp. (1) SCC 1, and 
Food Corporation of
India and Others Vs. Parashotam Das Bansal and Others,
(2008) 5 SCC 100, the Division Bench of the High Court further
concluded, that the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet
was not bound by the recommendation of the Selection Board.
It accordingly held, that for justifiable reasons, the Appointments
Committee of the Cabinet had the right to either accept, or to
refuse the recommendation of the Selection Board. In sum and
substance it came to be concluded, that unless it was shown
that the determination of the Appointments Committee of the
Cabinet suffered from arbitrariness or malafides and
capriciousness, the same could not be interfered with. The
Division Bench of the High Court having found none of the
above noted vices in the determination of the Appointments
Committee of the Cabinet, answered the second question also
in the negative.
13. Based on its aforementioned determination, the High
Court dismissed Writ Appeal No. 779 of 2009, on 21.7.2009.
Dissatisfied with the order dated 5.5.2009 (passed by the
Single Judge of the High Court, dismissing Writ Petition No.
15508 of 2009), and the order dated 21.7.2009 (passed by the
Division Bench of the High Court dismissing Writ Appeal No.
779 of 2009), the appellant approached this Court by filing
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (C) No. 2008 of 2010. On
11.1.2010 this Court issued notice in this matter. On
completion of pleadings the matter was listed for final disposal.
14. Leave granted.
15. On 29.8.2013 while hearing the matter this Court
passed the following order:
ﬁBefore we proceed for further hearing in the matter, we
would like to go through the deliberations of the
Appointments Committee of the Cabinet [for short ‚the
ACC™] by which the recommendations of the Selection
Board was not accepted in the case of the petitioner.
Hence the records of the Selection Board and the final
orders passed therein in the case of the petitioner be
placed before the Court on the next date of hearing, i.e.,
10th September, 2013.ﬂ
Thereafter on 12.9.2013 this Court passed the following order:
ﬁWe have perused the record produced before us and we
have also heard the arguments of learned Additional
Solicitor Generalﬂ
Ld. A.S.G. has sought time to seek instructions.
On the next date, Ld. A.S.G. will ensure that a copy of the
note put up to the A.C.C. and the decision of A.C.C. as
well as a copy of the recommendation dated 27th
February, 2008 of the Selection Board are made available
to the Court
List this matter on 23rd September, 2013.ﬂ
The summoning of the record referred to in the orders extracted
hereinabove, had become essential for two reasons. Firstly, the
appellant did not contest the findings recorded by the Division
Bench of the High Court on the two questions framed by the
High Court, for the disposal of Writ Appeal No. 779 of 2009.
Having given our thoughtful consideration to the determination
rendered by the High Court, on the two questions framed by it,
we must acknowledge that the High Court was fully justified in
drawing its conclusions. We therefore hereby affirm the above
findings recorded by the High Court. According to the appellant,
the High Court had misdirected itself in its above determination.
It was the submission of the appellant, that the determination

of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, was not
supported by justifiable reasons. It was asserted, that the
determination of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet
was arbitrary, and based on extraneous consideration. Insofar
as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, it was the
vehement submission of the appellant, that the High Court had
not addressed the issue at all.
1
6. The solitary contention advanced at the hands of the
appellant, was based on the recommendation made by the
Selection Board on 27.2.2008, and the consideration of the
above recommendation by the Appointments Committee of the
Cabinet (leading to the rejection of the appellant™s claim for the
promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General). For effectively
understanding and determining the solitary contention at the
hands of the appellant, it is essential to extract the minutes of
the meeting of the Selection Board dated 27.2.2008, as also,
the proceedings of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet.
Without understanding the tenor and effect of the above
deliberations, it would not be possible to express our findings
and the reasons. Had the above proceedings revealed
sensitive material, improper for public consumption, or
detrimental to national interest, we would have chosen to tread
cautiously. The deliberations which resulted in denial of
promotion to the appellant (to the rank of Lieutenant General),
however, have no such misgivings. We have therefore no
hesitation in extracting the minutes of the meeting of the
Selection Board dated 27.2.2008. The same are being
reproduced hereinunder:-
ﬁMINUTES OF (1/2008) DRDO SELECTION BOARD
MEETING HELD ON 27 FEB 2008

from an officer, Maj Gen PP Das, alleging discrimination.
4. In terms of the provisions of Section 16A(4) of the Army
Act an officer who has attained the age of retirement or
has become due for such retirement on completion of his
tenure, may be retained in the service for a further period
by the Central Government, if the exigencies of the service
so require.
5. 
It is evident from the above provisions that for grant of
extension in service, the requirement to be fulfilled,
primarily, is the exigencies of service. In the note which was
put up to the Raksha Mantri soliciting approval to the
proposal for grant of extension, no such exigency has been
cited. The only issue that was mentioned in support of the
proposal for extension was that the officer had been
recommended for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General. This in the background of the provisions of the
Act mentioned above, is no sufficient ground for extension.
6. The Chief Controller Research & Development with
whom the matter was discussed has provided copies of
orders issued in the years 1995 and 1996 when officers
of the rank of Major General were granted extensions.
Extensions in service were granted with the approval of the
Integrated Finance Division in the Ministry of Defence
though approval of the finance angle is not strictly relevant
to the grant of extensions. The other two instances cited
are of Shri P. Venugopalan, Outstanding Scientist in the
DRDL, Hyderabad who was granted extension pending a
decision on the question of his regular extension under
FR.56 as a Scientist; and of the post retirement
appointment of Vice Admiral PC Bhasin on contract basis
in the ATVP. These two cases are not relevant to the case
of Maj Gen Singh, present under consideration.
The proceedings recorded by the Appointments Committee of
the Cabinet while rejecting the appellant™s claim for promotion
to the rank of Lieutenant General are also being set out below:-
ﬁThe Ministry of Defence has, with the approval of the
Raksha Mantri proposed the promotion of IC-23289 Maj
Gen HM Singh, a permanently seconded officer of the
DRDO, to the rank of Lieutenant General.
2.
Maj Gen HM Singh (dob: 02.02.1949) was due for
superannuation on 29th February, 2008 on attaining the
age of 59 years which is the age of superannuation for
officers of the rank of Major Generals who are permanently
seconded to the DRDO. A Selection Board which met on
27th February, 2008 to consider eligible officers of the
rank of Major General permanently seconded to the DRDO
for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General,
recommended Major General Singh for promotion. As the
officer was due for retirement on 29th February, 2008
approval of the Raksha Mantri was obtained for giving him
extension of service of three months in the rank of Major
General or till the approval of the Appointments Committee
of the Cabinet to his promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General, whichever is earlier. Officers in the rank of
Lieutenant General retire on attaining the age of 60 years.
3. The propriety of grant of extension to the officer at the
verge of his superannuation and also, that of grant of
promotion to the officer while on extension has been
examined. The matter has been discussed, separately,
with officers from the Department of Personnel and
Training; the DRDO, and also, the Ministry of Defence
(Military Secretary™s Branch). This apart, a legal notice has
been received alleging perjury on the basis of information
secured from the Ministry of Defence under the Right to
Information Act. A representation has also been received

17. The appellant points out, that the determination of the
Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, overlooked the factual
position stated in the counter affidavit, filed jointly on behalf of
respondent nos. 1 and 2 (respondent no.1 Œ the Union of India,
through Secretariat of the Appointments Committee of the
Cabinet; and respondent no. 2 Œ the DRDO through its Director
General). In this behalf our attention was drawn to paragraphs
3 (xvii) and 3 (xviii) which are being extracted below:
ﬁ3 (xvii) 
A meeting of the Selection Board was held on
27.2.2008 and the Selection Board recommended the
name of the petitioner for promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General
. The post of Lieutenant General then
carried the pay scale of Rs.22400-525-24500. 
Any
appointment against this post requires the approval of
7. An instance has been cited, during discussions, of
extension of service granted in the year 1997 or
thereabouts to Major General Malik who was due for
superannuation, and his promotion to the rank of Lt. Ge
n
while on extension.
8. 
The orders issued by the Department of Personnel and
Training lay down that while extension could be granted in
exceptional circumstances, there can be no promotion
during the period of such extension. These orders apply
to the civilian establishment. The instructions which apply
to the Defence forces permit extension in service only if
the exigencies so demand. DRDO is mainly civilian, and
the Rules, as mentioned above, do not permit promotion
on extension
.
9. 
The above apart, the plea taken the representation of
Maj Gen P.P. Das, and also the legal notice needs to be
kept in view. Instances of officers in the Armed Forces
retiring just before the vacancies coming their way and
being denied empanelment are not uncommon.
Extensions motivated by reasons of promotion being close
at hand can have repercussions
.
10. The above part, the ACR format which is followed for
the officers of this rank, seconded to the DRDO, which has
been applied for recording of ACRs in the present case
reveal that fitness for promotion should be specifically
recorded in the ACr. A perusal of the ACR of Maj Gen
Singh reveals that specific record of fitness for promotion
has not been made.
11. 
More pointedly, two questions stand out, firstly, the
doubtful authority and grounds for granting extensions,
taking into account that there was no exigency and,
secondly, extensions, motivated by a promotion in the
offing during the extension period cannot be allowed. It

Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC)
(Respondent No.1), which is a high power body
 consisting
of the Hon™ble Prime Minister of India, Hon™ble Union
Home Minister, Hon™ble Union Minister of Department of
Personnel and Hon™ble Union Defence Minister. As such,
the recommendation of the Selection Board were sent to
ACC. 
In DRDO, the retirement age of an officer of the rank
of Maj Gen/equivalent which the petitioner held at that time
is 59 years. The petitioner was due to retire from service
w.e.f 29.2.2008. Under these circumstances, he was given
an extension of service for a period of three months or till
the decision of ACC was received whichever was earlier.
As the decision of ACC was not received till 31.5.2008,
his service was extended further for a period of one month
w.e.f 1.6.2008 on the same terms and conditions
.
3 (xviii) The decision of ACC (Respondent No.1) regarding
non-approval of promotion of the petitioner to the rank of
Lieutenant General communicated vide letter dated
2.6.2008 was received by respondent no. 2 on 3.6.2008
and the latter had to issue orders of the petitioner™s
retirement from service from 3.6.2008.ﬂ
(emphasis is ours)
18. Referring to the factual position depicted in the joint
counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent nos. 1 and 2,
it was the vehement submission of the appellant, that the
Appointments Committee of the Cabinet exceeded its
jurisdiction in examining the validity of the orders by which the
appellant was granted extension in service. It was the
submission of the appellant, that the only question before the
Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, consequent upon the
recommendations made by the Selection Board on 27.2.2008,
was in connection with the merits of the claim of the appellant,
for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. Adding to the
above contention, it was also the submission of the appellant,
that the Selection Board, consequent upon its deliberations held
on 27.2.2008, arrived at its findings based on the appellant™s
service record, past performance, qualities of leadership, as
well as, vision, that the appellant was worthy of promotion to
the rank of Lieutenant General. The Appointments Committee
of the Cabinet, during the course of its deliberations, did not
find fault with the above conclusion drawn by the Selection
Board. As such, it was sought to be asserted, that even the
Appointments Committee of the Cabinet must be deemed to
have endorsed the merit and suitability of the appellant, for
promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General.
19. In order to contest the submissions advanced at the
hands of the appellant, learned senior counsel representing
(respondent nos. 1 and 2) emphatically relied upon the
proceedings of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet.
The proceedings under reference have been extracted by us
hereinabove. Referring to the above proceedings, learned
senior counsel for the respondents laid great emphasis on the
observations recorded in paragraphs 8 and 9 thereof. It was
pointed out, that in terms of the orders issued by the
Department of Personnel and Training, promotion during the
period of extension was unquestionably barred. In this behalf it
was the contention of the learned senior counsel for the
respondents, that with effect from 1.3.2008, the appellant (who
had attained the age of retirement on superannuation on
29.2.2008), was on extension in service. There was, therefore,
no question of his being considered for promotion during the
period of such extension. In addition to the aforesaid categoric
stand adopted by the learned senior counsel for the
respondents, it was sought to be reiterated, that the orders
dated 29.2.2008 and 30.5.2008, by which the appellant was
granted extension in service, for periods of three months and
one month respectively, were not sustainable in law, inasmuch
as, they were in violation of Rule 16A of the Army Rules which
postulates, that an officers who has attained the age of
retirement or has become due for such retirement on
completion of his tenure, may be retained in service for a further
         SUPREME COURT REPORTS    [2014] 1 S.C.R.
period by the Central Government, only if the exigencies of
service so require. It was the submission of learned senior
counsel for the respondents, that retention in service of the
appellant was not on account of any exigency of service.
20. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the
submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for
the rival parties. First and foremost, we have no hesitation in
endorsing the submission advanced at the hands of the
appellant, that the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet did
not in any manner upset the finding recorded by the Selection
Board, in respect of the merit and suitability of the appellant
for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. On the instant
aspect of the matter, the Appointments Committee of the
Cabinet has maintained a sullen silence. Even in the pleadings
filed on behalf of the respondents, there is an ironic quiescence.
Therefore, all other issues apart, the appellant must be deemed
to have been found suitable for promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General, even by the Appointments Committee of
the Cabinet.
21. We have extracted hereinabove the factual position
noticed by the respondents in paragraphs 3(xvii) and 3(xviii) of
their counter affidavit. If the aforesaid averments are read in
conjunction to the factual position, that the vacancy against
which the claim of the appellant was considered, had arisen
on 1.1.2007, it clearly emerges, that the appellant was the
senior most eligible officer holding the rank of Major General
whose name fell in the zone of consideration for promotion. The
Selection Board having conducted its deliberations singularly
chose the name of the appellant from the panel of four names
before it. The proceedings of the Selection Board reveal, that
its recommendations were based on record of service, past
performance, qualities of leadership, as well as, vision. No
other name besides the appellant™s name was recommended
for promotion. Having been so recommended, the President
of India, in the first instance, by an order dated 29.2.2008,
extended the service of the appellant, for the period of three
months with effect from 1.3.2008 ﬁor till the approval of the ACC
whichever is earlierﬂ. Since the Appointments Committee of the
Cabinet did not render its determination within the extended
period expressed in the order dated 29.2.2008, yet another
order to the same effect was issued by the President of India
on 30.5.2008 extending the service of the appellant for a further
period of one month with effect from 1.6.2008 ﬁor till the approval
of the ACC whichever is earlierﬂ. The President of India,
therefore, was conscious of the fact while granting extension
in service to the appellant, the appellant™s case for onward
promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General was under
consideration. Therefore, to ensure that the aforesaid
consideration fructified into a result one way or the other,
extensions were granted to the appellant twice over. The
aforesaid determination at the hands of the President of India
in granting extension in service to the appellant, stands noticed
in the factual position expressed in paragraphs 3(xvii) and
3(xviii) of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents
1 and 2. It is not possible for us to accept, that the aforesaid
determination in allowing extension in service to the appellant
can be described as being in violation of the norms stipulated
in Rule 16A of the Army Rules. It is necessary in this behalf,
for us to test the above conclusion drawn by us, on the
touchstone of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It
is not a matter of dispute, that the appellant was promoted to
the rank of substantive Major General with effect from 7.1.2004.
It is also not a matter of dispute, that the substantive vacancy
in the rank of Lieutenant General, against which the appellant
was eligible for consideration, became available with effect from
1.1.2007. Even though the appellant had nearly 14 months of
military service remaining at the aforesaid juncture, the
procedure contemplated for making promotions to the rank of
the Lieutenant General was initiated for the first time just two
days before the date of retirement of the appellant, on
27.2.2008. Although it is the contention of the learned senior

counsel for the respondents, that the delay in convening the
Selection Board and conducting its proceedings was not
deliberate or malafide, yet there can be no doubt about the fact,
that the appellant was not responsible for such delay. For all
intents and purposes, he was repeatedly seeking consideration
orally as well as in writing. He had been repeatedly informing
the authorities about the approaching date of his retirement. In
response, he was always assured, that if found suitable, he
would be actually promoted prior to the date of his retirement.
It was for the respondents to convene the meeting of the
Selection Board. Since the Selection Board came to be
convened for the vacancy which had arisen on 1.1.2007 only
on 27.2.2008, the respondents must squarely shoulder the
blame and responsibility of the above delay.
22. The question that arises for consideration is, whether
the non-consideration of the claim of the appellant would violate
the fundamental rights vested in him under Articles 14 and 16
of the Constitution of India. The answer to the aforesaid query
would be in the affirmative, subject to the condition, that the
respondents were desirous of filling the vacancy of Lieutenant
General, when it became available on 1.1.2007. The factual
position depicted in the counter affidavit reveals, that the
respondents indeed were desirous of filling up the said vacancy.
In the above view of the matter, if the appellant was the senior
most serving Major General eligible for consideration (which he
undoubtedly was), he most definitely had the fundamental right
of being considered against the above vacancy, and also the
fundamental right of being promoted if he was adjudged
suitable. Failing which, he would be deprived of his fundamental
right of equality before the law, and equal protection of the laws,
extended by Article 14 of the Constitution of India. We are of
the view, that it was in order to extend the benefit of the
fundamental right enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution
of India, that he was allowed extension in service on two
occasions, firstly by the Presidential order dated 29.2.2008, and
thereafter, by a further Presidential order dated 30.5.2008. The
above orders clearly depict, that the aforesaid extension in
service was granted to the appellant for a period of three
months (and for a further period of one month), or till the
approval of the ACC, whichever is earlier. By the aforesaid
orders, the respondents desired to treat the appellant justly, so
as to enable him to acquire the honour of promotion to the rank
of Lieutenant General, (in case the recommendation made in
his favour by the Selection Board was approved by the
Appointments Committee of the Cabinet), stands affirmed. The
action of the authorities in depriving the appellant due
consideration for promotion to the rank of the Lieutenant
General, would have resulted in violation of his fundamental right
under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Such an action at
the hands of the respondents would unquestionably have been
arbitrary. We are therefore of the view, firstly, that the order
allowing extension in service of the appellant for a period of
three months, dated 29.2.2008, and the order allowing further
extension in service by one month to the appellant, dated
30.5.2008, so as to enable his claim to be considered for
onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, cannot be
held to be in violation of the statutory provisions. Rule 16A of
the Army Rules, postulates extension in service, if the
exigencies of service so require. The said parameter must
have been duly taken into consideration when the Presidential
Orders dated 29.2.2008 and 30.5.2008 were passed. The
respondents have neither revoked, nor sought revocation of the
above orders. Therefore, it does not lie in the mouth of the
respondents to question the veracity of the above orders. The
above orders were passed to ensure due consideration of the
appellant™s claim for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General. Without rejecting the above claim on merits, the
appellant was deprived of promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General. Besides the above, we are also of the considered
view, that consideration of the promotional claim of the senior
most eligible officer, would also fall in the parameters of the rule
providing for extension, if the exigencies of service so require.

It would be a sad day if the armed forces decline to give effect
to the legitimate expectations of the highest ranked armed
forces personnel. Specially when, blame for delay in such
consideration, rests squarely on the shoulders of the authorities
themselves. This would lead to individual resentment,
bitterness, displeasure and indignation. This could also
undoubtedly lead to, outrage at the highest level of the armed
forces. Surely, extension of service, for the purpose granted to
the appellant, would most definitely fall within the realm of Rule
16A of the Army Rules, unless of course, individual resentment,
bitterness, displeasure and indignation, of army personnel at
the highest level is of no concern to the authorities. Or
alternatively, the authorities would like to risk outrage at the
highest level, rather than doing justice to a deserving officer.
Reliance on Rule 16A, to deprive the appellant of promotion,
to our mind, is just a lame excuse. Accordingly, extension in
service granted to the appellant, for all intents and purposes,
in our considered view, will be deemed to satisfy the
parameters of exigency of service, stipulated in Rule 16A of
the Army Rules.
23. While dealing with the issue of consideration of the
appellant™s claim for onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant
General, it is necessary for us to also conclude by observing,
that had the claim of the appellant not been duly considered
against the vacancy for the post of Lieutenant General, which
became available with effect from 1.1.2007, we would have had
to hold, that the action was discriminatory. This because, of
denial of due consideration to the appellant, who was the senior
most eligible serving Major General, as against the claim of
others who were junior to him. And specially when, the
respondents desired to fill up the said vacancy, and also
because, the vacancy had arisen when the appellant still had
14 months of remaining Army service. Surely it cannot be over
looked, that the Selection Board had singularly recommended
the name of the appellant for promotion, out of a panel of four
names. In such an eventuality, we would have no other
alternative but to strike down the action of the authorities as
being discriminatory and violative of Article 16 of the
Constitution of India.
24. The deliberations recorded by us hereinabove are
incomplete, inasmuch as, we have not answered the pointed
objection raised by the learned senior counsel for the
respondent nos. 1 and 2, namely, that an officer is not entitled
to promotion during the period of extension in service. For the
instant objection raised at the hands of the respondents, it is
necessary to refer to the deliberations of the Appointments
Committee of the Cabinet, and specially paragraphs 8 and 9
thereof. A collective reading of the paragraphs 8 and 9 reveals
an extremely relevant objective, namely, situations wherein an
officer attains the age of retirement without there being a
vacancy for his consideration to a higher rank, even though he
is eligible for the same. Such an officer who is granted
extension in service, cannot claim consideration for promotion,
against a vacancy which has become available during the
period of his extension in service. The above conclusion drawn
by us is clearly apparent from the paragraph 9 of the
proceedings of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet.
In fact in the operative part of the proceedings recorded in
paragraph 11, it has been noticed, that .ﬂ–extensions motivated
by a promotion in the offing during the extension period cannot
be allowed–ﬂ We can derive only one meaning from the above
observations, namely, extension being granted for promotion
against a vacancy in the offing. That is to say, retention in
service, so as to consider an officer for a vacancy which has
not become available prior to his retirement, but is in the offing.
The above reason recorded in the operative part of the
proceedings of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet,
is laudible and legal. Insofar as the present controversy is
concerned, there is no doubt whatsoever, that a clear vacancy
against the rank of Lieutenant General became available with
effect from 1.1.2007. At that juncture, the appellant had 14
months of service remaining. It is not as if the vacancy came

into existence after the appellant had reached the age of
retirement on superannuation. The present case is therefore,
not covered by the technical plea canvassed at the hands of
the learned senior counsel for the respondents. The denial of
promotion to the appellant mainly for the reason, that the
appellant was on extension in service, to our mind, is
unsustainable besides being arbitrary, specially in the light of
the fact, that the vacancy for which the appellant was clamouring
consideration, became available, well before the date of his
retirement on superannuation. We have, therefore, no hesitation
in rejecting the basis on which the claim of the appellant for
onward promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General was
declined, by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet.
25. In view of the fact, that we have found the order of
rejection of the appellant™s claim for promotion to the rank of
Lieutenant General, on the ground that he was on extended
service to be invalid, we hereby set aside the operative part of
the order of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. It is
also apparent, that the Selection Board had recommended the
promotion of the appellant on the basis of his record of service,
past performance, qualities of leadership, as well as, vision, out
of a panel of four names. In its deliberations the Appointments
Committee of the Cabinet, did not record any reason to negate
the aforesaid interference, relating to the merit and suitability
of the appellant. We are therefore of the view, that the appellant
deserves promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, from the
date due to him. Ordered accordingly. On account of his
promotion to the post of Lieutenant General, the appellant would
also be entitled to continuation in service till the age of
retirement on superannuation stipulated for Lieutenant Generals,
i.e., till his having attained the age of 60 years. As such, the
appellant shall be deemed to have been in service against the
rank of Lieutenant General till 28.2.2009. Needless to mention,
that the appellant would be entitled to all monetary benefits
which would have been due to him, on account of his promotion
to the rank of Lieutenant General till his retirement on
superannuation, as also, to revised retiral benefits which would
have accrued to him on account of such promotion. The above
monetary benefits shall be released to the appellant within three
months from the date a certified copy of this order becomes
available with the respondents.
26. Allowed in the aforesaid terms.
